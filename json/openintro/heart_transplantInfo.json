   "description" : "Description\nThe Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine\nwhether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each\npatient entering the program was designated officially a heart transplant\ncandidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit\nfrom a new heart. Then the actual heart transplant occurs between a few\nweeks to several months depending on the availability of a donor. Very few\ncandidates during this waiting period show improvement and get\ndeselected as a heart transplant candidate, but for the purposes of\nthis experiment those patients were kept in the data as continuing\ncandidates.",
