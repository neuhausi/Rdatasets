   "description" : "Description\nResearchers tested the deterrence hypothesis which predicts that the\nintroduction of a penalty will reduce the occurrence of the behavior subject\nto the fine, with the condition that the fine leaves everything else\nunchanged by instituting a fine for late pickup at daycare centers.\nFor this study, they worked with 10 volunteer daycare centers that did not\noriginally impose a fine to parents for picking up their kids late.\nThey randomly selected 6 of these daycare centers and instituted a monetary\nfine (of a considerable amount) for picking up children late and then removed it.\nIn the remaining 4 daycare centers no fine was introduced.\nThe study period was divided into four: before the fine (weeks 1â4), the first\n4 weeks with the fine (weeks 5-8), the entire period with the fine (weeks 5â16),\nand the after fine period (weeks 17-20). Throughout the study, the number of kids\nwho were picked up late was recorded each week for each daycare. The study\nfound that the number of late-coming parents increased significantly when the\nfine was introduced, and no reduction occurred after the fine was removed.",
