Of course, not all loans are created equal. Someone who is a\nessentially a sure bet to pay back a loan will have an easier time getting a\nloan with a low interest rate than someone who appears to be riskier. And\nfor people who are very risky? They may not even get a loan offer, or they\nmay not have accepted the loan offer due to a high interest rate. It is\nimportant to keep that last part in mind, since this dataset only\nrepresents loans actually made, i.e. do not mistake this data for loan\napplications!",
