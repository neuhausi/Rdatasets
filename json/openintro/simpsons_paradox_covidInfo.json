   "description" : "Description\nA dataset on Delta Variant Covid-19 cases in the UK. This dataset gives a great example of Simpson's Paradox. When aggregating results without regard to age group, the death rate for vaccinated individuals is higher &ndash; but they have a much higher risk population. Once we look at populations with more comparable risks (breakout age groups), we see that the vaccinated group tends to be lower risk in each risk-bucketed group and that many of the higher risk patients had gotten vaccinated. The dataset was brought to OpenIntro's attention by Matthew T. Brenneman of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Note: some totals in the original source differ as there were some cases that did not have ages associated with them.",
