The ball was found to be filled with air,\nbut since then many have tossed around the idea that a helium-filled\nfootball would outdistance an air-filled one. Students at Ohio State\nUniversity conducted an experiment to test this myth. They used two\nidentical footballs, one air filled with air and one filled with helium.\nEach football was kicked 39 times and the two footballs were alternated with\neach kick.\n</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<pre><code class='language-R'>helium\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Format</h3>\n<p>A data frame with 39 observations on the following 3 variables.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>trial</dt><dd><p>Trial number.</p>\n</dd> <dt>air</dt><dd><p>Distance in years for\nair-filled football.</p>\n</dd> <dt>helium</dt><dd><p>Distance in years for helium-filled\nfootball.</p>\n</dd> </dl>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p>Lafferty, M.
