The data were used for analyzing the relationship between\nconstitutional and ecological factors and sleeping in mammals. Two\nqualitatively different sleep variables (dreaming and non dreaming) were\nrecorded. Constitutional variables such as life span, body weight, brain\nweight and gestation time were evaluated. Ecological variables such as\nseverity of predation, safety of sleeping place and overall danger were\ninferred from field observations in the literature.",
