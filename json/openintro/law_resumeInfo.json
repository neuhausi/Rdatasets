First, the gender\nassociated with the resume was randomized by assigning a first name of\neither James or Julia. Second, the socioeconomic class of the candidate was\nrandomly assigned and represented through five minor changes associated with\npersonal interests and other other minor details (e.g. an extracurricular\nactivity of sailing team vs track and field). The outcome variable was\nwhether the candidate was received an interview.",
