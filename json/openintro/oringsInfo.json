   "description" : "Description\nOn January 28, 1986, a routine launch was anticipated for the Challenger\nspace shuttle. Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened: the\nshuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members on board. An\ninvestigation into the cause of the disaster focused on a critical seal\ncalled an O-ring, and it is believed that damage to these O-rings during a\nshuttle launch may be related to the ambient temperature during the launch.\nThe table below summarizes observational data on O-rings for 23 shuttle\nmissions, where the mission order is based on the temperature at the time of\nthe launch.",
