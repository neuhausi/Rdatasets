   "description" : "Description\nMale double-crested cormorants use advertising behavior to attract females for breeding.\nIn this study by Meagan McRae (2015), cormorants were observed two or three times a week\nat six stations in a tree-nesting colony\nfor an entire season, April 10, 2014-July 10, 2014.\nThe number of advertising birds was counted and these observations were classified\nby characteristics of the trees and nests.\nThe goal is to determine how this behavior varies temporally over the season and spatially,\nas well as with characteristics of nesting sites.",
   "reference" : "Observations were made on only 2 days in weeks 3 and 4, but 3 days in all other weeks.\nOne should use log(days) as an offset, so that the response measures rate.",
