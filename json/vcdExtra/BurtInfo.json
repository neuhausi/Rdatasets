   "reference" : "Burt says: \"In all, 217 individuals were examined, about two-thirds of them males.\nBut, partly to simplify the calculations and partly because the later observations were rather more trustworthy, \nI shall here restrict my analysis to the data obtained from the last hundred males in the series.\"",
