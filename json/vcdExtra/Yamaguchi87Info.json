This data set has\nbecome a classic for models comparing two-way mobility tables across\nlayers corresponding to countries, groups or time (e.g.,\nGoodman and Hout, 1998; Xie, 1992).\nThe US data were derived from the 1973 OCG-II survey; those\nfor the UK from the 1972 Oxford Social Mobility Survey; those\nfor Japan came from the 1975 Social Stratification and Mobility\nsurvey. They pertain to men aged 20-64.",
