First, the original accuracy\nwas scaled using the minimal and maximal score (a and b, respectively)\nthat can be obtained in the test: accuracy1 = (original_accuracy - a) / (b - a)\n(a and b are not provided). Subsequently, accuracy was obtained\nfrom accuracy1 by replacing all observations with a value of 1 with 0.99.",
