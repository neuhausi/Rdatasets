(2010). 129 women  were given a description of sex discrimination in the workplace (a male lawyer was promoted over a clearly more qualified female lawyer).  Subjects then read that the target lawyer felt that the decision was unfair.  Subjects were then randomly assigned to three conditions: Control (no protest), Individual Protest (&ldquo;They are treating me unfairly\") , or Collective Protest (&ldquo;The firm is is treating women unfairly\").",

This data set is also used as the &lsquo;protest&rsquo; data set by Hayes (2013 and 2018).  It is a useful example of mediation and moderation in regression. It may also be used as an example of plotting interactions."
