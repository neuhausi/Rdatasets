Leiman (1957) discuss how to transform a hierarchical factor structure to a bifactor structure. Schmid contains the example 12 x 12 correlation matrix. schmid.leiman is a 12 x 12 correlation matrix with communalities on the diagonal. This can be used to show the effect of correcting for attenuation. Two additional data sets are taken from Chen et al. (2006).\n</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<pre><code class='language-R'>data(Schmid)</code></pre>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p> Two artificial correlation matrices from Schmid and Leiman (1957). One real and one artificial covariance matrices from Chen et al. (2006). \n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p> Schmid: a 12 x 12 artificial correlation matrix created to show the Schmid-Leiman transformation. \n</p>\n</li>\n<li><p> schmid.leiman: A 12 x 12 matrix with communalities on the diagonal.  Treating this as a covariance matrix shows the 6 x 6 factor solution\n</p>\n</li>\n<li><p> Chen: An 18 x 18 covariance matrix of health related quality of life items from Chen et al. (2006). Number of observations = 403.  The first item is a measure of the quality of life.  The remaining 17 items form four subfactors: The items are (a) Cognition subscale: &ldquo;Have difficulty reasoning\nand solving problems?&quot;  &ldquo;React slowly to things that were said or done?&quot;; &ldquo;Become confused and start several actions at a time?&quot;  &ldquo;Forget where you\nput things or appointments?&quot;; &ldquo;Have difficulty concentrating?&quot;  (b) Vitality\nsubscale: &ldquo;Feel tired?&quot;  &ldquo;Have enough energy to do the things you want?&quot; (R) \n&ldquo;Feel worn out?&quot; ; &ldquo;Feel full of pep?&quot; (R). (c) Mental health subscale: &ldquo;Feel\ncalm and peaceful?&quot;(R)  &ldquo;Feel downhearted and blue?&quot;; &ldquo;Feel very\nhappy&quot;(R) ; &ldquo;Feel very nervous?&quot; ; &ldquo;Feel so down in the dumps nothing could\ncheer you up?  (d) Disease worry subscale: &ldquo;Were you afraid because of your health?&quot;; &ldquo;Were you frustrated about your health?&quot;; &ldquo;Was your health a worry in your life?&quot; .\n</p>\n</li>\n<li><p> West: A 16 x 16 artificial covariance matrix from Chen et al.
