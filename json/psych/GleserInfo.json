   "description" : "Description\nGleser, Cronbach and Rajaratnam (1965) discuss the estimation of variance components and their ratios as part of their introduction to generalizability theory.  This is a adaptation of their \"illustrative data for a completely matched G study\" (Table 3).  12 patients are rated on 6 symptoms by two judges.  Components of variance are derived from the ANOVA.",
   "reference" : "Generalizability theory is the application of a components of variance approach to the analysis of reliability.  Given a G study (generalizability) the components are estimated and then may be used in a D study (Decision).  Different ratios are formed as appropriate for the particular D study.",
