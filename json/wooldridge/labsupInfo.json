Students are asked to think about such issues in Computer Exercise C13 in Chapter 15. A more egregious version of this mistake would be to treat a variable such as age as a suitable instrument because it is beyond our control: clearly age has a direct effect on many economic outcomes that would play the role of the dependent variable.",
