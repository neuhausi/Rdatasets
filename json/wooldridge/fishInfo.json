   "reference" : "This is a nice example of how to go about finding exogenous variables to use as instrumental variables. Often, weather conditions can be assumed to affect supply while having a negligible effect on demand. If so, the weather variables are valid instrumental variables for price in the demand equation. It is a simple matter to test whether prices vary with weather conditions by estimating the reduced form for price.",
