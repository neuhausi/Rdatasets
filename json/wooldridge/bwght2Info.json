   "reference" : "There are many possibilities with this data set. In addition to number of prenatal visits, smoking and alcohol consumption (during pregnancy) are included as explanatory variables. These can be added to equations of the kind found in Exercise C6.10. In addition, the one- and five-minute APGAR scores are included. These are measures of the well being of infants just after birth. An interesting feature of the score is that it is bounded between zero and 10, making a linear model less than ideal. Still, a linear model would be informative, and you might ask students about predicted values less than zero or greater than 10.",
