One might collect more recent data and determine whether the spread has become a less accurate predictor of the actual outcome in more recent years. In other words, in the simple regression of the actual score differential on the spread, is the variance larger in more recent years. (We should fully expect the slope coefficient not to be statistically different from one.)",
