   "reference" : "Computer Exercise C15.3 is important for analyzing these data. There, it is shown that the instrumental variable, &lsquo;nearc4', is actually correlated with 'IQ', at least for the subset of men for which an IQ score is reported. However, the correlation between 'nearc4&ldquo; and 'IQ', once the other explanatory variables are netted out, is arguably zero. At least, it is not statistically different from zero. In other words, 'nearc4' fails the exogeneity requirement in a simple regression model but it passes, at least using the crude test described above, if controls are added to the wage equation. For a more advanced course, a nice extension of Card&rsquo;s analysis is to allow the return to education to differ by race. A relatively simple extension is to include black education (blackeduc) as an additional explanatory variable; its natural instrument is blacknearc4.",
