Lalonde (1986), âEvaluating the Econometric Evaluations of Training Programs with Experimental Data,â American Economic Review 76, 604-620. Professor Jeff Biddle, at MSU, kindly passed the data set along to me. He obtained it from Professor Lalonde. Data loads lazily.",
   "reference" : "Professor Lalonde obtained the data from the National Supported Work Demonstration job-training program conducted by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation in the mid 1970s. Training status was randomly assigned, so this is essentially experimental data. Computer Exercise C17.8 looks only at the effects of training on subsequent unemployment probabilities. For illustrating the more advanced methods in Chapter 17, a good exercise would be to have the students estimate a Tobit of re78 on train, and obtain estimates of the expected values for those with and without training. These can be compared with the sample averages.",
