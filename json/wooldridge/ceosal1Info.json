A good term project is to have students collect a similar data set using a more recent issue of Businessweek, and to find additional variables that might explain differences in CEO compensation. My impression is that the public is still interested in CEO compensation. An interesting question is whether the list of explanatory variables included in this data set now explain less of the variation in log(salary) than they used to.",
