   "reference" : "This is a nice change of pace from wage data sets for the United States. These data are for engineers in Thailand, and represents a more homogeneous group than data sets that consist of people across a variety of occupations. Plus, the starting salary is also provided in the data set, so factors affecting wage growth â and not just wage levels at a given point in time â can be studied. This is a good data set for a common term project that tests basic understanding of multiple regression and the interpretation of models with a logarithm for a dependent variable.",
