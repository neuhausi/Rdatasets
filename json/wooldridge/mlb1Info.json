The baseball statistics are from The Baseball Encyclopedia, 9th edition, and the city population figures are from the Statistical Abstract of the United States. Data loads lazily.",

   "reference" : "The baseball statistics are career statistics through the 1992 season. Players whose race or ethnicity could not be easily determined were not included. It should not be too difficult to obtain the city population and racial composition numbers for Montreal and Toronto for 1993. Of course, the data can be pretty easily obtained for more recent players.",
