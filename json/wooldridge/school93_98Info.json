It is unbalanced because data on scores and some of the spending and other variables is missing for some schools. While the usual RE and FE methods can be applied directly, obtaining the correlated random effects version of the Hausman test is more advance. Computer Exercise 17 in Chapter 14 walks the reader through it.",
