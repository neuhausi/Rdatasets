A very rich data set can now be obtained, even a panel data set for colleges across different years. Statistics on male/female ratios, fraction of men/women in fraternities or sororities, policy variables â such as a âsafe houseâ for women on campus, as was started at MSU in 1994 â could be added as explanatory variables. The crime rate in the host town would be a good control.",
