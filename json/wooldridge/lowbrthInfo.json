   "reference" : "This data set can be used very much like INFMRT.RAW. It contains two years of state-level panel data. In fact, it is a superset of INFMRT.RAW. The key is that it contains information on low birth weights, as well as infant mortality. It also contains state identifies, so that several years of more recent data could be added for a term project. Putting in the variable afcdprc and its square leads to some interesting findings for pooled OLS and fixed effects (first differencing). After differencing, you can even try using the change in the AFDC payments variable as an instrumental variable for the change in afdcprc.",
