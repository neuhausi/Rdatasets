   "reference" : "If you want to assign a common final project, this would be a good data set. There are many possible dependent variables, namely, prices of various fast-food items. The key variable is the fraction of the population that is black, along with controls for poverty, income, housing values, and so on. These data were also used in a famous study by David Card and Alan Krueger on estimation of minimum wage effects on employment. See the book by Card and Krueger, Myth and Measurement, 1997, Princeton University Press, for a detailed analysis.",
