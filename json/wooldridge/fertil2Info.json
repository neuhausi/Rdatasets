   "reference" : "Currently, this data set is used only in one computer exercise. Since the dependent variable of interest â number of living children or number of children every born â is a count variable, the Poisson regression model discussed in Chapter 17 can be used. However, some care is required to combine Poisson regression with an endogenous explanatory variable (educ). I refer you to Chapter 19 of my book Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data. Even in the context of linear models, much can be done beyond Computer Exercise C15.2. At a minimum, the binary indicators for various religions can be added as controls. One might also interact the schooling variable, educ, with some of the exogenous explanatory variables.",
