   "reference" : "This is much bigger than the other CPS data sets even though the sample is restricted to married women. (CPS91.RAW contains many more observations than MROZ.RAW, too.) In addition to the usual human capital variables for the women in the sample, we have information on the husband. Therefore, we can estimate a labor supply function as in Chapter 16, although the validity of potential experience as an IV for log(wage) is questionable. (MROZ.RAW contains an actual experience variable.) Perhaps more convincing is to add hours to the wage offer equation, and instrument hours with indicators for young and old children. This data set also contains a union membership indicator. The web site for the National Bureau of Economic Research makes it very easy now to download CPS data files in a variety offormats.
