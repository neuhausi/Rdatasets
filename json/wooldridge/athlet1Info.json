   "reference" : "These data were collected by Patrick Tulloch, an MSU economics major, for a term project. The âathletic successâ variables are for the year prior to the enrollment and academic data. Updating these data to get a longer stretch of years, and including appearances in the âSweet 16â NCAA basketball tournaments, would make for a more convincing analysis. With the growing popularity of womenâs sports, especially basketball, an analysis that includes success in womenâs athletics would be interesting.",
