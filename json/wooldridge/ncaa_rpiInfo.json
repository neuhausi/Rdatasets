   "reference" : "This is a nice example of how multiple regression analysis can be used to determine whether rankings compiled by experts â the so-called pre-season RPI in this case â provide additional information beyond what we can obtain from widely available data bases. A simple and interesting question is whether, once the previous yearâs post-season RPI is controlled for, does the pre-season RPI â which is supposed to add information on recruiting and player development â help to predict performance (such as win percentage or making it to the NCAA menâs basketball tournament). For the binary outcome that indicates making it to the NCAA tournament, a probit or logit model can be used for courses that introduce more advanced methods. There are some other interesting variables, such as coaching experience, that can be included, too."
