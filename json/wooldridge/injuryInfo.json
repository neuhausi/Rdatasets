Or, allowing for different intercepts for the two states, do the slopes differ? A good lesson from this example is that a small R-squared is compatible with the ability to estimate the effects of a policy. Of course, for the Michigan data, which has a smaller sample size, the estimated effect is much less precise (but of virtually identical magnitude).",
