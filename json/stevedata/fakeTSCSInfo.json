The outcome y\nis a linear function of a baseline for each hypothetical country, plus a yearly\ngrowth trend as well as varying growth errors for each country. x1 is\nsupposed to have a linear effect of .5 on y, all things considered.\nx2 is supposed to have a linear effect of 1 on y for each unit\nchange in x2, all things considered.",
