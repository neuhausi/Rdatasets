   "reference" : "Following my own work in Political Research Quarterly, terror\nincidents with unknown fatalities or number wounded were imputed to be 1.\nIn those cases, the GTD has reason to believe at least one person died or was\nwounded, but doesn't know how many. GTD is weird about 1993, so perhaps treat\nthose observations with some care (though it does well to capture the WTC\nbombing that year). Suicides include only those who passed, not those who\nsurvived a suicide attempt. Drunk-driving fatalities seem to include those\nwho were killed in a drunk-driving accident despite not being drunk themselves.",
