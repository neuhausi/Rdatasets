This dataset summarizes Table 1 and Table 2 from its website.\nThe primary interest here (for my purposes) is the ODGI indices\n(including the new 2012 measure). The data set includes constituent greenhouse\ngases/chlorines as well in parts per trillion. The primary use here is for\nin-class illustration.",
