First, the battery of abortion items can serve as\ntoy data to illustrate mixed effects modeling as equivalent to a\none-parameter (Rasch) model. Second, I include some covariates to also do some\nbasic regressions. I think abortion opinions are useful learning tools for\nstatistical inference for college students. Third, there's a time-series component\nas well for understanding how abortion attitudes have changed over time.",
