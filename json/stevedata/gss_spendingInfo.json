   "reference" : "For all the variables beginning with nat, note that I rescaled the original data so that -1 = respondent thinks country is spending too much on this topic, 0 = respondent thinks country is spending \"about (the) right\" amount, and 1 = respondent thinks country is spending too little on this topic. I do this to facilitate reading each nat prompt as increasing support for more spending (the extent to which increasing values means the respondent thinks the country spends too little on a given prompt). I think this is more intuitive.",
