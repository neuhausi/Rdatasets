   "description" : "Description\nA data set on government spending in select rich countries as a function of\ntrade/GDP, financial openness, and the state-year-level engagement in trade\nunions. The data offer a means to quasi-replicate Garrett's (1998) argument\nabout left-wing governments' ability to stem the tide of globalization's\neffect on decreased government spending.",

   "usage" : "PPGE",
   "reference" : "The data are an unbalanced panel because of data missingness primarily\naffecting Switzerland (which would only appear in the panel in earnest starting\nin the mid-1990s). The Netherlands has some missing data in the mid-1970s. Spain\nand Portugal appear at the start of the panel, though the transition to democracy\nfor both wouldn't start until 1974/1975. The data also have some obvious\nCOVID weirdness for 2020. Perhaps an honest re-assessment of Garrett (1998)\nmay want to drop Switzerland altogether, ignore 2020, and lop a few years off\nthe Spanish and Portuguese panel. What you do with the Netherlands is up to you.",
