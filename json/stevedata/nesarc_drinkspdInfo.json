Non-drinkers are coded as \\code{NA} in the \\code{s2aq8b} variable and should be recoded as 0. Any value between 1 and 98 in the variable represents the, for lack of better term, &#8288;true&rdquo; number of alcoholic drinks a respondent says s/he typically\nconsumes on a day drinking alcohol in the past 12 months, though this is evidently preposterous\nas a count variable. A person drinking 42 alcoholic drinks a day would not be alive to tell you\nthey did this. The researcher may want to employ some sensible right censoring here.",
