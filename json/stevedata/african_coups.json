(1984) will provide more information\nabout the data and hypotheses. There was a follow-up symposium on this in\n1986 in <em>American Political Science Review</em> that may be an interesting\nread and provide even more context about what's at stake in this debate.\n</p>\n<p>English country names are country names from around the time of publication.\nTake note of older names of &quot;Dahomey&quot;, &quot;Swaziland&quot;, &quot;Upper Volta&quot;, and &quot;Zaire.&quot;\nThe three-character ISO codes are current, mostly for ease of doing other\nthings with the data. However, this comes with the acknowledgment that\nDahomey and Zaire used to have different ISO codes under their older names.\nBoth codes for Dahomey (<code>DHY</code>) and Zaire (<code>ZAR</code>) were retired in 1977 and\n1997, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>Ideally, I'd have Morrison's (1972) <em>Black Africa</em>, but I do not. I have\na copy of a 1989 update, though. That's what I consulted in constructing\nthis data set.\n</p>\n<p>Jackman (1978) is deceptively opaque on what he's doing for the ethnic group\nvariable and arguably misleads on what his turnout variable is actually from.\nIn the case of the ethnic group variable, it's the difference between saying\nthe largest ethnic group in Rwanda is 98% of the population versus 80% of\nthe population. In short, it's the difference of saying whether there are\nany Tutsi at all in the country. Basically, I'm uncertain with what he's\ndoing with what Morrison et al. (1989) define as &quot;ethnic clusters&quot;.\n</p>\n<p>Mercifully, the coup variables come from a replication by Johnson et al.\n(1984). Based on Morrison et al.'s (1989) updated data, it's not clear how\nJackman could've derived some of these estimates using the formula he said\nhe used. For example, Benin should have a score of 39 based on the\ninformation in Table 2.10 (p. 373 in Morrison et al. (1989)). Cameroon should\nhave a 1 and not a 2, per Table 5.10 (p. 399). My comments here work under\nthe assumption that Morrison et al. are adding information and not revising\ninformation in the second edition of the <em>Black Africa</em> handbook.\n</p>\n<p>To be more precise, both the Jackman coup index and total military involvement\nvariables are directly copied from Table 2 in Johnson et al. (1984) on p. 627.\nMissingness in the Jackman coup index variable communicates the country was\nnot included in his original study, but was included in the Johnson et al.\nreplication.\n</p>\n<p>Related: the agricultural variable is a midway point between columns B and\ncolumns C in Table 3.11 of Morrison et al. (1989). I do not think this is too\nfar removed from what Jackman was looking at in an older version of the same\ndata, but there will be slight differences. It's the difference of &quot;these\nvariables came from 1966&quot; versus &quot;this is an imputation of 1960 to 1970&quot;. The\nlatter is what I offer here. I can only do so much here.\n</p>\n<p>To continue this theme of the opacity in trying to reconstruct the data, it\nseems Jackman (1978, p. 1265) misleads the reader a bit in saying that the\nsocial mobilization index incorporates the percentage of the labor force that\nis not employed in agriculture. He seems to have meant that he's using the\npercentage of the labor force that is employed in industry. Otherwise, the\nsummary statistics he reports could not be reproduced or reasonably\napproximated by way of Morrison et al. (1989). This industry percentage\nvariable comes from Table 3.14 in Morrison et al. (1989) and is likewise a\nmidway point between 1960 and 1970.\n</p>\n<p>The literacy variables have suffices communicating where I obtained them. The\nCross-National Time Series Database has a variable effectively communicating\nthis information that I was using first in trying to recreate these data.\nThese data come from 1965 in that data set. Jackman and Johnson et al. are\nassuredly using Morrison's almanac. That information is in Table 4.11 of\nMorrison et al. (1989), though it's possible the estimates contained therein\nare slightly different than what was reported in the first edition. I cannot\nknow for sure.\n</p>\n<p>Ethiopia is conspicuously missing in the party dominance variable. That's by\ndesign, and apparently its omission warranted ample discussion both by\nJackman (1978) and Johnson et al. (1984). Johnson et al. (1984, fns. 4,5)\nargue it's a curious choice that can situationally influence the results that\nJackman reports, but there are also lots of other choices made by Jackman\n(1978) that can influence these results.\n</p>\n<p>I am 99.9% sure the turnout variable is Table 5.9 in Morrison et al. (1989).\nJackman (1978) says this is from <em>before</em> independence but I'm confident he\nmeant it was the turnout at the independence referendum.\n</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Jackman, Robert W. 1978. &quot;The Predictability of Coups d'etat: A Model with\nAfrican Data.&quot; <em>American Political Science Review</em> 72(4): 1262-75.\n</p>\n<p>Jackman, Robert W., Rosemary H.
