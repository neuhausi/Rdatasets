There are purportedly\n85 responses in this raw variable where the respondent said they voted, but this could not be confirmed from\nregistration records. Those cases are recorded as NA. The educ variable ranges from 1 (finished 8th\ngrade or less than that) to 10 (respondent holds an advanced degree). The uid variable is a simple sequence variable\nranging from 1 to 2257 and is calculated on the original 1984 time-series study (May 3, 1999 version)\nbefore other recoding was done. This should allow some reproducibility for an interested user.",
