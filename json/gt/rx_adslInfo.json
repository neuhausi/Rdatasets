   "description" : "Description\nThis tibble contains artificial data for 182 subjects of the GT01 study.\nEach row corresponds to demographic characteristics of a single trial\nparticipant. Two out of 182 study participants were screen failures and\nthus not treated, the rest of the study population was randomized with a\n1:1 ratio to receive either \"Placebo\" (as comparator) or \"Drug 1\". The\ndataset entails subject level demographics such as age, age group, sex,\nethnicity, and body mass index (BMI) at baseline, as well as an event\nflag, indicating whether the subject experienced a specific event\nthroughout the course of the study or not.\nAlthough the data was intentionally created to mimic a typical clinical\ntrial dataset following the CDISC format, it might not strictly comply\nwith CDISC ADaM rules. The intent is to showcase the workflow for clinical\ntable creation rather than creating a fully CDISC-compliant ADaM dataset.",
