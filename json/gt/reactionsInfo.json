   "description" : "Description\nThe reactions dataset contains kinetic data for second-order (two body)\ngas-phase chemical reactions for 1,683 organic compounds. The reaction-rate\nvalues and parameters within this dataset are useful for studies of the\natmospheric environment. Organic pollutants, which are present in trace\namounts in the atmosphere, have been extensively studied by research groups\nsince their persistence in the atmosphere requires specific attention. Many\nresearchers have reported kinetic data on specific gas-phase reactions and\nthese mainly involve oxidation reactions with OH, nitrate radicals, ozone,\nand chlorine atoms.\nThis compilation of rate constant (k) data as contains the values for rate\nconstants at 298 K (in units of &#8288;cm^3 molecules^-1 s^-1&#8288;) as well as\nparameters that allow for the calculation of rate constants at different\ntemperatures (the temperature dependence parameters: A, B, and n).\nUncertainty values/factors and temperature limits are also provided here\nwhere information is available.",
