The values originate from the 2018 adjustment which is based on the\nlatest relevant precision measurements and improvements of theoretical\ncalculations. Such work has been carried out under the authority of the\nTask Group on Fundamental Constants (TGFC) of the\nCommittee on Data of the International Science Council (CODATA). These\nupdated values became available on May 20, 2019. They are published at\nhttp://physics.nist.gov/constants, a website of the\nFundamental Constants Data Center of the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg,\nMaryland, USA.",
