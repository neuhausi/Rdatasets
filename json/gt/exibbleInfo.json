It\ncontains only eight rows with numeric, character, and factor columns. The\nlast 4 rows contain NA values in the majority of this tibble's columns (1\nmissing value per column). The date, time, and datetime columns are\ncharacter-based dates/times in the familiar ISO 8601 format. The row and\ngroup columns provide for unique rownames and two groups (grp_a and\ngrp_b) for experimenting with the gt() function's rowname_col and\ngroupname_col arguments.",
