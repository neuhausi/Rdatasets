   "description" : "Description\nA dataset with information on all 314 Paris Metro stations as of June 2024.\nEach record represents a station, describing which Metro lines are serviced\nby the station, which other connections are available, and annual passenger\nvolumes. Basic location information is provided for each station in terms\nof where they reside on a municipal level, and, through latitude/longitude\ncoordinate values.\nThe system has 16 lines (numbered from 1 to 14, with two additional lines:\n3bis and 7bis) and covers over 200 kilometers of track. The Metro runs on\nstandard gauge tracks (1,435 mm) and operates using a variety of rolling\nstock, including rubber-tired trains and steel-wheeled trains (which are far\nmore common).\nThe Metro is operated by the RATP, which also operates other transit systems\nin the region, including buses, trams, and the RER. The RER is an important\ncomponent of the region's transit infrastructure, and several RER stations\nhave connectivity with the Metro. This integration allows passengers to\ntransfer between those two systems seamlessly. The Metro also has connections\nto the Transilien rail network, tramway stations, several major train\nstations (e.g., Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, etc.), and many bus lines.",
   "parameters" : {
      "connect_transilien" : "Connections with Transilien lines. This system has\neight lines in operation (H, J, K, L, N, P, R, and U).",
      "passengers" : "The total number of Metro station entries during 2021. Some\nof the newest stations in the Metro system do not have this data, thus they\nshow NA values.",
      "caption" : "In some cases, a station will have a caption that might\ndescribe a nearby place of interest. This is NA if there isn't a caption\nfor the station name.",
      "connect_rer" : "Station connections with the RER. The RER system has\nfive lines (A, B, C, D, and E) with 257 stations and several interchanges\nwith the Metro.",
      "location" : "The arrondissement of Paris or municipality in which the\nstation resides. For some stations located at borders, the grouping of\nlocations will be presented as a comma-separated series",

      "connect_other" : "Other connections with transportation infrastructure\nsuch as regional, intercity, night, and high-speed trains (typically at\nrailway stations).",
      "connect_tram" : "Connections with tramway lines. This system has twelve\nlines in operation (T1, T2, T3a, T3b, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T11, and T13)\nwith 235 stations.",
      "latitude, longitude" : "The location of the station, given as\nlatitude and longitude values in decimal degrees."
