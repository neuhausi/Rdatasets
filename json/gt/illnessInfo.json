The table comprises laboratory findings for the patient from day 3 of\nillness onset until day 9 (after which the patient died). YF viral DNA was\nfound in serum samples from day 3, where the viral load reached 14,000 copies\nper mL. Several medical interventions were taken to help the patient,\nincluding the administration of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, red cells,\nand coagulation factor VIII. The patient also received advanced support\ntreatment in the form of mechanical ventilation and plasmapheresis. Though\nthe patient's temperature remained stable during their illness,\nunfortunately, the patient's condition did not improve. On days 7 and 8, the\npatient's health declined further, with symptoms such as nosebleeds,\ngastrointestinal bleeding, and hematoma.",
