   "reference" : "The Streptomycin for Tuberculosis trial in 1948 was considered the first modern randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which could be done in part because there were very limited supplies of streptomycin in the UK after World War II. \nThis publication seems a bit primitive today, without standard features like a proper Table 1, and some creative use of graphs to display baseline characteristics of the study sample \nMore strikingly, there is no ethics committee approval, or consent. \nYou can read the pdf of the original journal article at Streptomycin in TB Study. \nThis was the first of a series of 3 trials, in which the initial effectiveness of Streptomycin was established, but rapid resistance developed, and significant side effects occurred at a dose of 2 grams of streptomycin. This type of resistance also occurred with another new anti-tubercular therapy at the time, PAS (Para-Amino-Salicylate). Subsequent trials B and C evaluated different doses and combinations of Streptomycin and PAS, and were published together in 1952 in the BMJ, with the pdf available here 1952 Three Streptomycin in TB Studies Summarized. \nCommentary on the conduct of these trials from one of the MD investigators can be found at MD Clinical Trialist Commentary. \nCommentary on the design and analysis of these trials from statistician A. Bradford Hill can be found at Statistican Commentary.",
