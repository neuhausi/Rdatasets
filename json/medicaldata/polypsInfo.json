   "reference" : "FAP is an inherited condition caused by mutations in the APC  (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) gene that leads to early and frequent formation of precancerous polyps of the colon at a young age, and invariably leads to the development of colon cancer at a young age.  \nEarly, frequent surveillance colonoscopy and polyp removal is helpful, but this study examined whether there is a beneficial effect of preventive medical therapy with the nonsteroidal pain reliever, sulindac, versus placebo in a RCT vs placebo in 22 participants, with polyp number measured (via colonoscopy) at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months after starting the study drug. Note that one subject did not return for the 12 month colonoscopy.",
