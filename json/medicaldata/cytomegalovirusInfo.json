   "description" : "Description\nThis data set contains 64 consecutive patients who underwent T-cell replete, matched sibling donor reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The primary risk factor of interest was the number of activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (aKIRs: 1-4 vs. 5-6). (more details after variable information).",
