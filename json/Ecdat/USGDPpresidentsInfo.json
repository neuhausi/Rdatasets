In addition, the \n\nNorthwest Indian War involved very roughly \n30 battle deaths per year per million\npopulation 1785-1795.  This compares with the\nroughly 100 battle deaths per year 1812-1815\nfor the \n\nWar of 1812.  \n\nFor present purposes, the Spanish-American \nWar is combined with the lesser-known \nAmerican-Philippine War:  The latter \ninvolved 50 percent more battle deaths but \nover a longer period of time and arguably \nwith less impact on the stature of the US as \na growing world power.  However, its \nmagnitude suggest it might have impacted the \nUS economy in a way roughly comparable to \nthe Spanish-American war.  The two are\ntherefore listed here together as \n\"Spanish-American-Philippine\" war.  \n\nThe Correlates of \nWar (COW) data include multiple US uses \nof military force  during the Vietnam War \nera.  It starts with \"Vietnam Phase 1\", \n1961-65, with 506 battle deaths in the COW \ndata base.  It includes the \"Second \nLaotian\" war phases 1 and 2, plus \nengagement with a \"Communist Coalition\" \nand Khmer Rouge as well as actions in the\nDominican Republic and Guatemala.  The \ncurrent data.frame includes \nonly \"Vietnam\", referring primarily to \nCOW's \"Vietnam War, Phase 2\", 1965-1973.  \nThe associated battle deaths include \nbattle deaths from these other, lesser\nconcurrent conflicts.  \n\nThe COW data currently ends in 2007.  \nHowever, the post-2000 conflicts in \nAfghanistan and Iraq averaged less than \n1,000 battle deaths per year or roughly 3\nbattle deaths per year per million population.\nThis is below the threshold of 10 battle \ndeaths per year per million population.  \nThis in turn suggests that any impact of \nthose conflicts on the US economy might be\nsmall and difficult to estimate.",

   "description" : "Description\nIt is commonly claimed that Franklin Roosevelt \n(FDR) did not end the Great Depression:  World \nWar II (WW2) did.  This is supported by the 10.6\npercent growth per year in real Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) per capita seen in the standard \nGDP estimates from 1940 to 1945.  It is also \nsupported by the rapid decline in unemployment\nduring the war.\nHowever, no comparable growth spurts in GDP per \ncapita catch the eye in a plot of \nlog(GDP per capita) from 1790 to 2015,\nwhether associated with a war or not, using data\nfrom Measuring Worth.  The only other features \nof that plot that seem visually comparable are \nthe economic disaster of Herbert Hoover's\npresidency (when GDP per capital fell by 10 \npercent per year, 1929-1932), the impressive \ngrowth of the US economy during the first seven\nyears of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency (6.4\npercent per year, 1933-1940), and the post-World\nWar II recession (when GDP per capita fell by \n7.9 percent per year, 1945-1947).  (NOTE:  The \nweb site for Measuring Worth, \nhttps://measuringworth.com/ still works, \nbut has not always been maintained to current\ninternet security standards.  Therefore, the \nlink is provided here in text but not as a link.)\nCloser inspection of this plot suggests that the \nUS economy has generally grown faster after FDR\nthan before.  This might plausibly be attributed \nto \n\n\"The Keynesian Ascendancy 1939-1979\".\nUnemployment dropped during the First World War \nas it did during WW2.  Comparable unemployment \ndata are not available for the U.S. during other\nmajor wars, most notably the \nAmerican Civil War and the \nMexican-American War.\nThis data set provides a platform for testing \nthe effects of presidency, war, and Keynes.  It\ndoes this by combining the numbers for US\npopulation and real GDP per capital dollars from\nMeasuring Worth with the presidency and a list \nof major wars and an estimate of the battle\ndeaths by year per million population.  (As \nnoted above, the web address for measuring worth, \nhttps://measuringworth.com/, often gives \nsecurity warnings but still seems to provide the \ndata as before.)\nUS unemployment is \nalso considered.",
