The clusters in this\ndesign are geographic areas served by a single cable television system.\nSo as to facilitate analysis, the researchers restricted their\nattention to small cable systems whose reach is limited to a single zip\ncode.  Further, since the experiment was fielded during the last week\nof the presidential election, the researchers restricted their search\nto cable systems that were not in the 16 hotly-contested\n&ldquo;battleground&rdquo; states (as designated by the <em>Los Angeles\nTimes</em>).\n</p>\n<p>Eighty-five cable systems were available for randomization and were\nassigned to treatment after stratification on previous turnout levels\nin presidential elections (as determined from analysis of the\ncorresponding states' voter registration files).  Each cable system was\nmatched with one or sometimes two other cable systems in the same\nstate, yielding 40 strata.  Then within each strata, cable systems were\nrandomly assigned to treatment and control conditions.  Strata 3, 8 and\n25 have two control cable systems and 1 treated system each, while\nstrata 6 and 20 have two treated cable systems and one control system.\nThe remaining 35 strata have 1 treated cable system and 1 control\nsystem.  In this way there are 38 + 4 = 42 treated systems, spanning 40\nexperiment strata.\n</p>\n<p>The treatment involved researchers purchasing prime-time advertising\nspots on four channels in the respective cable system in which the\nresearchers aired voter mobilization ads.  The ads were produced by\n<em>Rock the Vote</em>, targeted at younger voters, and aired four times\nper night, per channel, over the last eight days of the election\ncampaign.  After the election, public records were consulted to\nassemble data on turnout levels in the treated and control cable\nsystems.  In the analysis reported in Green and Vavreck (2008), the\nresearchers focused on turnout among registered voters aged 18 and 19\nyears old.\n</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Green, Donald P. and Lynn Vavreck. 2008.
