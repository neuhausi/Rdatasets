The data set also contains information on several risk factors.\nThe data in this data set are simulated from detailed competing risk survival\ncurves and counts of numbers of patients per group presented in Lu-Yao et al. (2009).\nThus, the simulated data presented here contain many of the characteristics of\nthe original SEER-Medicare prostate cancer data used in Lu-Yao et al. (2009).",
