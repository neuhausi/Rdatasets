In estimating\nthe prevalence of AIDS, account must be taken of the unknown number of cases\nwhich have been diagnosed but not reported.  The data set here records the\nreported cases of AIDS diagnosed from July 1983 and until the end of 1992.  \nThe data are cross-classified by the date of diagnosis and the time delay in \nthe reporting of the cases.",

      "delay" : "The time delay (in months) between diagnosis and reporting. 0 means that the\ncase was reported within one month.  Longer delays are grouped in 3 month\nintervals and the value of delay is the midpoint of the interval (therefore\na value of 2 indicates that reporting was delayed for between 1 and 3 \nmonths)."
