(1977) at Stanford University.  After reaching a\nstage of remission through treatment by chemotherapy, patients were randomized\ninto two groups. The first group received maintenance chemotherapy and the \nsecond group did not.  The aim of the study was to see if maintenance \nchemotherapy increased the length of the remission.  The data here formed a\npreliminary analysis which was conducted in October 1974.",
