It is a multivariate\ntime series of class \"ts\" and also inherits from class \"data.frame\".\nThis data set is part of a long study into body temperature regulation in\nbeavers.  Four adult female beavers were live-trapped and had a \ntemperature-sensitive radio transmitter surgically implanted.  Readings were\ntaken every 10 minutes.  The location of the beaver was also recorded and\nher activity level was dichotomized by whether she was in the retreat or \noutside of it since high-intensity activities only occur outside of the \nretreat.\nThe data in this data frame are those readings for one of the beavers on a day\nin autumn.",
