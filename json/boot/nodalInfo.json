   "description" : "Description\nThe nodal data frame has 53 rows and 7 columns.\nThe treatment strategy for a patient diagnosed with cancer of the prostate\ndepend highly on whether the cancer has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes.\nIt is common to operate on the patient to get samples from the nodes which can\nthen be analysed under a microscope but clearly it would be preferable if an\naccurate assessment of nodal involvement could be made without surgery.\nFor a sample of 53 prostate cancer patients, a number of possible predictor\nvariables were measured before surgery.  The patients then had surgery to \ndetermine nodal involvement.  It was required to see if nodal involvement could \nbe accurately predicted from the predictor variables and which ones were\nmost important.",
