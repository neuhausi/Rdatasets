Each experiment\nproduced a number of replicate estimates of g using the same\nmethodology.  Although the basic method remained the same for all\nexperiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there were changes in\nconfiguration.\nThe gravity data frame contains the data from all eight\nexperiments.  The grav data frame contains the data from the\nexperiments 7 and 8.  The data are expressed as deviations from 980.000\nin centimetres per second squared.",
