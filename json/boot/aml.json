(1977) at Stanford University.  After reaching a\nstage of remission through treatment by chemotherapy, patients were randomized\ninto two groups. The first group received maintenance chemotherapy and the \nsecond group did not.  The aim of the study was to see if maintenance \nchemotherapy increased the length of the remission.  The data here formed a\npreliminary analysis which was conducted in October 1974.\n</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<pre><code class='language-R'>aml\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Format</h3>\n<p>This data frame contains the following columns:\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>time</code></dt><dd>\n<p>The length of the complete remission (in weeks).\n</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>cens</code></dt><dd>\n<p>An indicator of right censoring.  1 indicates that the patient had a relapse\nand so <code>time</code> is the length of the remission. 0 indicates that the patient\nhad left the study or was still in remission in October 1974, that is the\nlength of remission is right-censored.\n</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>group</code></dt><dd>\n<p>The group into which the patient was randomized.
