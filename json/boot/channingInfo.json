These data \nwere\ncollected between the opening of the house in 1964 until July 1, 1975.  In that\ntime 97 men and 365 women passed through the centre.  For each of these, their\nage on entry and also on leaving or death was recorded.  A large number of the\nobservations were censored mainly due to the resident being alive on July 1,\n1975 when the data was collected.  Over the time of the study 130 women and\n46 men died at Channing House.  Differences between the survival of the sexes,\ntaking age into account, was one of the primary concerns of this study.",
