One site in each pair had a sign erected warning of the\ndangers of speeding and asking drivers to slow down.  No action was taken at\nthe second site.  Three sets of measurements were taken at each site.  Each set\nof measurements was nominally of the speeds of 100 cars but not all sites have\nexactly 100 measurements. These speed measurements were taken before the \nerection of the sign, shortly after the erection of the sign, and again after \nthe sign had been in place for some time.",
