   "description" : "Description\nwool is a time series of class \"ts\" and contains 309 observations.\nEach week that the market is open the Australian Wool Corporation set a floor\nprice which determines their policy on intervention and is therefore a \nreflection of the overall price of wool for the week in question.  Actual prices\npaid can vary considerably about the floor price.  The series here is the log\nof the ratio between the price for fine grade wool and the floor price, each\nmarket week between July 1976 and Jun 1984."
