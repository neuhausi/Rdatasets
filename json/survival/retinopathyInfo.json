Each patient had one eye randomized\nto laser treatment and the other eye received no treatment,\nand has two observations in the data set.\nFor each\neye, the event of interest was the time from initiation of treatment\nto the time when visual acuity dropped below 5/200 two visits in a row.\nThus there is a built-in lag time of\napproximately 6 months (visits were every 3 months).  Survival times\nin this dataset are the actual time to vision loss in months,\nminus the minimum possible time to event (6.5 months).  Censoring was\ncaused by death, dropout, or end of the study.",
