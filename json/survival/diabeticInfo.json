Each patient had one eye randomized\nto laser treatment and the other eye received no treatment.  For each\neye, the event of interest was the time from initiation of treatment\nto the time when visual acuity dropped below 5/200 two visits in a row.\nThus there is a built-in lag time of\napproximately 6 months (visits were every 3 months).  Survival times\nin this dataset are therefore the actual time to blindness in months,\nminus the minimum possible time to event (6.5 months).  Censoring was\ncaused by death, dropout, or end of the study.",
