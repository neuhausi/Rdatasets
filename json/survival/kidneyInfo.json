Each patient has exactly 2 observations.\nThis data has often been used to illustrate the use of random effects\n(frailty) in a survival model.  However, one of the males (id 21) is a\nlarge outlier, with much longer survival than his peers.  If this\nobservation is removed no evidence remains for a random subject effect.",
