   "description" : "Description\nData on recurrences of bladder cancer, used by many people\nto demonstrate methodology for recurrent event modelling.\nBladder1 is the full data set from the study. It contains all three treatment\narms and all recurrences for 118 subjects; the maximum observed number\nof recurrences is 9.\nBladder is the data set that appears most commonly in the literature. \nIt uses only the 85 subjects with nonzero follow-up who were\nassigned to either thiotepa or placebo, and only the first four recurrences\nfor any patient.  The status variable is 1 for\nrecurrence and 0 for everything else (including death for any reason).\nThe data set is laid out in the competing risks format of the paper by\nWei, Lin, and Weissfeld.\nBladder2 uses the same subset of subjects as bladder, but formatted in the\n(start, stop] or Anderson-Gill style.  \nNote that in transforming from the WLW to the AG style data set there\nis a quite common programming mistake that leads to extra follow-up time\nfor 12 subjects: all those with follow-up beyond their 4th recurrence.\nThis \"follow-up\" is a side effect of throwing away all events after the\nfourth while retaining the last follow-up time variable from the\noriginal data.  The bladder2 data set found here does not make this\nmistake, but some analyses in the literature have done so; it results\nin the addition of a small amount of immortal time bias and \nshrinks the fitted coefficients towards zero.",
