Their baseline to model innovation is the Poisson model,\nbut they also consider negative binomial models.\nBerger et al. (2017) argue that nonlinearities in the innovation process emerge in case that the first\ninnovation is especially hard to obtain in comparison to succeeding innovations.\nThen, hurdle models offer a useful way that allows for a distinction between these two processes.\nBerger et al. (2017) show that an extended analysis with negative binomial hurdle models\ndiffers materially from the outcomes of the single-equation Poisson\napproach of Aghion et al. (2013).",
