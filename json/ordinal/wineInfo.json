Two treatment factors (temperature and contact) each have two\nlevels. Temperature and contact between juice and skins can be\ncontrolled when cruching grapes during wine production. Nine judges\neach assessed wine from two bottles from each of the four treatment\nconditions, hence there are 72 observations in all.",
