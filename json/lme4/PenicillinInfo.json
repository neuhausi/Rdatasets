   "description" : "Description\nSix samples of penicillin were tested using the B.\nsubtilis plate method on each of 24 plates.  The\nresponse is the diameter (mm) of the zone of inhibition\nof growth of the organism.",
   "usage" : "A data frame with 144 observations on the following 3 variables.",
   "reference" : "The data are described in Davies and Goldsmith (1972) as\ncoming from an investigation to &ldquo;assess the\nvariability between samples of penicillin by the B.\nsubtilis method.  In this test method a bulk-inoculated\nnutrient agar medium is poured into a Petri dish of\napproximately 90 mm. diameter, known as a plate.  When\nthe medium has set, six small hollow cylinders or pots\n(about 4 mm. in diameter) are cemented onto the surface\nat equally spaced intervals.  A few drops of the\npenicillin solutions to be compared are placed in the\nrespective cylinders, and the whole plate is placed in an\nincubator for a given time.  Penicillin diffuses from the\npots into the agar, and this produces a clear circular\nzone of inhibition of growth of the organisms, which can\nbe readily measured.  The diameter of the zone is related\nin a known way to the concentration of penicillin in the\nsolution.&rdquo;",
