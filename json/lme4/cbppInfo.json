The goal of the survey was to study the\nwithin-herd spread of CBPP in newly infected herds. Blood\nsamples were quarterly collected from all animals of\nthese herds to determine their CBPP status.  These data\nwere used to compute the serological incidence of CBPP\n(new cases occurring during a given time period).  Some\ndata are missing (lost to follow-up)."
