   "usage" : "This pharmaceutical data set was used to develop a model for predicting\ncompounds' permeability. In short, permeability is the measure of a\nmolecule's ability to cross a membrane. The body, for example, has notable\nmembranes between the body and brain, known as the blood-brain barrier, and\nbetween the gut and body in the intestines. These membranes help the body\nguard critical regions from receiving undesirable or detrimental substances.\nFor an orally taken drug to be effective in the brain, it first must pass\nthrough the intestinal wall and then must pass through the blood-brain\nbarrier in order to be present for the desired neurological target.\nTherefore, a compound's ability to permeate relevant biological membranes\nis critically important to understand early in the drug discovery process.\nCompounds that appear to be effective for a particular disease in research\nscreening experiments, but appear to be poorly permeable may need to be\naltered in order improve permeability, and thus the compound's ability to\nreach the desired target. Identifying permeability problems can help guide\nchemists towards better molecules.",
