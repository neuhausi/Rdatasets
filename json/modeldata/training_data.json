            "I absolutely LOVE this dried fruit.  LOVE IT.  Whenever I have a craving for something sweet, I can usually rip open one of these bags and forget all about eating something bad.<br /><br />I've tried every one of their choices but this bag is my favorite.  The apples and apricots are nice and sweet and the peaches give a little tang.  The fruit is also nice and crisp, not stale and bland.  I recommend this mix highly.  Kids love it too so this makes a great lunchbox snack.  Also wonderful for road trips.",
            "GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT TOO.  Much cheaper than WalMart and I don't need to lug it home, it appears on my doorstep.  Cats hack up fewer hair balls and instead of adding petroleum products (ie-vaseline) like most HAIRBALL formulas, which causes diarrhea and blocks vitamin absorption, this one has probiotics, which make the digestive tract work better, thus eliminating most of the hairball problem in a healthy way.  (Nothing can prevent 100% of hairball hacking, it's just something all cats do once in awhile.)  A great deal on a great product, plus free shipping when you order over a certain amount.---Coos Bay Sandra",
            "Great flavor, we go through a ton of this sauce! I discovered it in a local grocery store and then was happy to buy larger quantities on amazon. Excellent quality and adds life to tvp dishes.",
            "This is excellent salsa/hot sauce, but you can get it for $29.95 from the El Fenix store site.",
            "Again, this is the best dogfood out there.  One suggestion:  the bag is a bit hard to get into because the string doesn't pull very easy.  Thanks!",
            "The box I received was filled with teas, hot chocolates, and none of the  Holiday  flavors advertised.  Not even worth my time to return it.. totally disappointed!  And it took almost 2 weeks to arrive too.  My box contained mainly the Grove Square instant cappuccino/hot chocolate style k cups.  No Gingerbread, Pumpkin Spice or Spicy Eggnog.  The only  Limited Edition  flavors I received was Green Mountain Island Coconut. Don't waste your money on this one, not even close to what is advertised!",
            "This is delicious coffee which compares favorably with much higher priced coffee.  It's a well-kept secret!  Low acidity and smooth taste are hallmarks of this brew.<br /><br />I especially liked the fact that each bag is resealable to keep the coffee at maximum freshness.  I will definitely buy again and again.",
            "Don't let these little tiny cans fool you.  They pack a lot of food.  When you dish it out you can see the seafood, vegetables, brown rice. etc.  It smells like it is seasoned and my dogs love it.  I used this quality food to help my little  portly ballerina  doxie with her weight problem.",
            "One of the nicest, smoothest cup of chai I've made. Nice mix of spices, largest overtone is the cardamom, but since i do like a half/half of tea with milk or soy milk as my chai drink, this is a good base for me.",
            "I'd never heard of these before, but I found a bag at my local liquidation store and decided to give 'em a try. They are among the best plain potato chips I've ever tasted. They have the perfect amount of salt, the perfect amount of curl and the perfect amount of crunch. They really do live up to their own hype.",
            "On Time and product looked like it should, the kids love this stuff and we sale it for $1.50 and it goes fast!",
            "I've ordered this food before, and it's one of my dog's favorites.<br />This last shipment, however, contained many dented cans, which does not instill confidence.<br />I'd say about 20% were dented, though so far all the food has been fine.  This is an observation about quality control more than it is a complaint, and I'll likely order again.",
            "I love Ghiradelli - and when I couldn't find the chips in my local store, I was delighted to find them online at Amazon.  The chips are fantastic quality, and when I received them in mid-summer in Nebraska (typically 90-100 F) they arrived packaged appropriately were in perfect condition.  The cookies I made didn't last long.",
            "I'm sorry, but who in their right mind is going to pay 5.99 plus 7 dollars shipping for one 41/2 oz puch of baby food? Get real!!!",
            "I love this tea! Who ever thinks of it as cheap should really consider the complexity and the harmony of the flavors that come through with each cup. It may not be the prized white tea, but the nutty taste keeps you wanting more. It's a great part of my tea alternation. I go from something fruity to nutty interchangably. For my nutty trips I consider a cup of Genmai cha and Oolong and for the fruity I recommend a cup of Orange Blossom White Tea. Also try Japanese charry green. Enjoy!",
            "We travel to VA frequently. I used to buy these there as favors for neighbors and then have the hassle of getting them back home. Now I just order from Amazon to arrive on the day we get home - the price is much less and no shipping hassles. The quality is excellent, I've tried the Costco version and they are just not as good and nowhere near as good as Planters or others.",
            "3/23/11  South New Jersey<br />I've been buying DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Peppers for about six months now.  All I can say is that if you don't have home roasted peppers on hand these grilled piquillo peppers will definitely fit the bill.  These are the tastiest purchased grilled/roasted peppers that we have ever tasted and I think we are roasted pepper connoisseurs.  This company also does sell a roasted piquillo pepper which for our taste is not quite as tasty as the grilled.  Don't get me wrong, their roasted are also good, but the grilled are over the top.  I do  roast  my own and the way I do them we as well as anyone who has ever tasted them go crazy for them.  But again, if you need or would rather purchase cooked peppers the DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Pepper will not disappoint you.  I usually purchase them at the store, however, when I checked the price of them online there was quite a savings at Amazon for a case of 12.  The case arrived in good condition and the jars had an appropriate expiration date on them.  No matter where you get them they are a little pricey, but someone grew and cared for these peppers, grilled, jared, labeled and shipped them.  Allot went into these little jars.  Whenever you see red peppers know that whoever grew them took care of them much longer to get them to the red stage rather than picking green.  I make my own salad dressings and I do add the liquid from the jar to my dressing.  The liquid is  flavored with the natural oil from the peppers and is delicious.  Try them!  You'll like them!",
            "I've used brining bags before so when I saw a good price on this 6 pack I thought I was doing myself a favor. I was dead wrong. Thanksgiving eve I went to turn my turkey over and the top opened up completely from the slightest movement. I had turkey brine spilling out into the fridge and all over the floor. Not something I needed to deal with when I was trying to get my pies baked and the table set.<br /><br />If I weren't a pregnant working mom of a toddler I would return these, but I think I will pass them on to some frenemies instead.",
            "In a word: FUN. You would not believe how a pair of eyes can transform a bowl of ice cream. And if you really get into it (whip cream hair, sprinkles for a beard, candy for the mouth) it can bring ice cream sundae parties to a whole new high. Plus, they taste good.",
            "Having a puppy means having enough things for him to chew on. I love these bully sticks because they last a really long time and can keep him busy chewing for what seems like forever. Because they last so long they are economical as you don't have to buy them week after week. Bottom line is he loves them and I lvoe that he loves them.",
            "We've been fans of Sutter Home Fre wines for years.  They're flavorful, yet nonalcoholic, and low in calories.  They taste like real wine, not like fruit juice.  Fre Brut is a particular favorite.  We like to keep it on hand for guests who don't drink alcohol.",
            "This is a great product.  I've been drinking it almost daily for over 40 years.  Carnation changed the vanilla flavor a few years ago.  They received a complaint from me, and apparently many others, about it. It tasted good, like butterscotch, but I wanted vanilla.  They eventually returned the vanilla to the original recipe.  I use it mostly in protein shakes.  But I do like the occasional frozen mug with just the powder and cold milk.  Remember to put the powder in first.  Always leave enough room to stir vigorously.  Try really hard not to drink it all without coming up for air.  It's hard to do but you can do it.  In other words - savor and make it last.  The energy boost is almost immediate.  I don't use the sugar-free.  Hence the immediate boost.",
            "While I agree the taste isn't the greatest, neither is the fat on a body. This is not a product I would recommend switching to if you were simply looking for a jello pudding alternative. You will shock your taste buds! The product is geared for bodybuilders or people used to protein supplements.<br /><br />Another problem is almost as soon as the powder and water merge, it begins to congeal, making it difficult to scrape out of the blender or off the mixer paddles. In other words, you lose a lot of the pudding. However, the powder mix is cheaper than the can contained (premixed) protein puddings I have seen.<br /><br />As far as nutritional value, it is a worthwhile product. (145 cal, 3g fat, 4g carbs, 25g protein) The sodium is a bit high at 550 mg per serving. I usually have one serving if I find my protein is a bit short for the day, so it is not a staple in my diet. I don't think I would be able to eat one every meal or day! I'm leaning more toward obtaining an unflavored protein powder for my low protein days and eat the pudding only once a month or so.",
            "I like to snack on pumpkin seeds because they pack in a lot of nutrients, but I have never been a big fan of the taste. That doesn't matter a bit with these seeds. The spice is what you notice with these pumpkin seeds: the  hot  is pretty darn hot ... not to make you run for a glass of water, but hot enough that you'll want a long drink when you're done. The bags aren't huge, so 15 of them is not a forever supply. I go through 1 or 2 per week eating the  recommended  serving size pretty much daily. Good product. Good price. And organic to boot.",
            "Had some freeze dried mushrooms prior that could be kept in Pantry, very convenient. These recommended to be kept in freezer after opening. Also needed to be soaked in liquid prior to use; NOT convenient. They also had a foul odor.",
            "I am so happy Amazon has finally started to ship Hayashi. It is so hard to find here in the US, and when you do find it, it is absurdly expensive and almost expired. This stuff is like a Japanese beef stew. It comes in a block rue form to make what is called Hayashi Rice. All you do is cook some thinly cut beef with some sliced onion and carrots (you can add other vegetables if you wish to experiment) and then add the correct amount of water, bring to boil and add the appropriate amount of Hayashi rue. It has a very smooth taste and tastes as if it originates from a tomato base (but without the normal tangy tomato flavor). Most people pour it on top of Japanese rice like you would Japanese curry. If you're looking for a warm and easy to make meal, this is it. One box of hayashi will serve a large family or provide a small family with enough for two meals. This pack includes 10 boxes so you'll be hard pressed to run out of the stuff quickly (unless you live in my house). The box includes two blister packs of the rue. Each blister pack can be divvied up to make 4 blocks of rue in case you want to make an individual size serving. Each block of the four out of one blister pack is supposed to be equal to one large serving.<br /><br />I ate this stuff all the time when I lived in Japan. It was my favorite dish and my wife would make it for me on a weekly basis. Now I can have it on a regular basis here in the states. Thanks Amazon!",
            "Good alternative to coconut oil when oiling your hair.  I usually use coconut oil but will occasionally use this oil for my very long hair.  It moisturizes well and washes out easily.",
            "I am officially addicted to coffee, I mean the real coffee which I roast, grind and brew, the first time I had Yiragachefe was when I was deployed to Iraq, my wife neighbors and some other family members knew I really can not live with out coffee, up on my return from Iraq I went to Ethiopian store in San Diego and asked store owner if he has this brand, unfortunately in the USA this brand is sold only by starbucks, but he told me to try some other export standard version of Ethiopian coffee brand, I try 1LB that was my starting point to roast my own coffee, it is almost three years now. That store is on Al-Cajon PVD and I had 15% discount every time I buy my coffee, finally when I moved to East cost I bought 30lb in fear of availability in Louisiana.<br /><br />I am not sure about legitimacy of Indian store in selling Ethiopian coffee but I highly recommend this coffee only if you really know what coffee means, the real coffee comes unroast, and ungrounded 2 shoots of Espresso can keep you moving the whole 8 working hours, this is natural straight from jungle and it's organic no hormone or fertilizer is used to grow it, sadly once it hits our American market it start giving part of its caffeine away to energy drinks and some other things so you will never find real clean and untouched one  on any market but in Ethiopian Stores. I will add some pictures of my newly roasted coffee and show you how easy it is to roast 1.5LB of coffee in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Please try this unroasted organic you will really like the taste and you will enjoy your day.",
            "This is a great cup of coffee! For a regular cup we usually have Nabob and get it through the Subscribe & Save.  The Dark Italian Roast is a keeper and will be replacing the Nabob as soon as Amazon gets the Subscribe & Save going.",
            "These are great beans for the price. If you live in a big city, however, I'd suggest buying green beans at a local Ethiopian shop or even a community Coop. I also remember a Pea berry out of East Timor that was outstanding, but this Tanzanian Pea berry is comparable to standard beans.",

I said to myself  wow these crackers taste pretty good  then I looked at the box. 3 Grams of Sugar in just 2 crackers?<br /><br />Why bother with a whole grain cracker if it's got that much sugar in it?<br /><br />I know most people don't care (so I won't bad mouth them too much) but I've got to keep my sugar intake down. That's the only reason why I gave them a 3 instead of a 5.",

I almost decided not to because generally I haven't liked anything but the  double  sized T-Discs from Starbucks and the new Gevalia ones that are decent.<br /><br />Anyhow, I brought a package home and tried it out, fully expecting to not like it or to have to stop it half way through to get a decent flavor.  To my surprise, it is very good!  After a having it a few times now, I do try and stop it just short of a full brew for a more robust flavor, but even if I let it go it's still pretty decent.<br /><br />I'll be buying more of these for sure, I'd definitely recommend them.",
            "I love Annie's products and these crackers are my new favorite.  Annie's Bunny Classics Saltine Crackers are just the right size, very tasty and not too salty.

            "I must admit that I am only a casual coffee drinker. However, I love nothing more than to relax with a nice cup of coffee after dinner. Kahve Koffee's Decaf Danish blend does the trick for me. Not only did this coffee win several awards in blind taste tests, but it is reasonably priced too! I strongly recommend this award-winning blend for all coffee drinkers. And for those of you, nay-sayers that turn their nose up to decaf coffee, just give it a try, I guarantee that you won't be able to taste the difference.",
            "I love these raisins, and sun maid is the best I have tasted so far.  This packaging with the little boxes is perfect to grab and go.  If my energy drops while I am out I just reach in my purse and have just the right snack to keep going.  These also taste amazing, it's a good thing I got them in this packaging, I can see myself easily just eating the whole bag.  I have even converted my husband, instead of a candy bar I give him a box of raisins instead he loves them and with fewer calories it has helped in his quest to lose weight, he is down 30 pounds so far.  Just from cutting back in these little ways, I have also lost 40 pounds and the raisins are good for you, kind of like concentrated wine to me.  I was having liver problems and switching to these type of snacks along with exercise has cured my liver ailment.  I say try them to anyone, my husband was a chocolate bar, I hate yogurt guy and he loves these yogurt covered raisins.  Recommend them to everyone when they ask about our change in diet.  I know they aren't perfect the sugar in the yogurt is high.  My one and only recommendation to sun maid is to find a sugar free yogurt the raisins are sweet enough.",
            "Excellent product.  All natural ingredients (real lemons crystalized into powder form) and only 5 calories (sweetned with Stevia).

You will love it.",

Campofrio is not considered in Spain a gourmet Jamon but it is a very well known brand that consistently delivers an excellent quality. Do not forget that a gourmet  Jamon Serrano  even in Spain sells for $400 to $1200. In any case I honestly believe that considering price and quality this is by far the best deal I have seen in the US and only 2 clicks away.",
            "On the advice of a friend (whose taste in whiskey is now suspect) I purchased a bottle of Amrut Single Malt (peated).  I am generally partial to single malts with a strong peat flavor - I was a fan of Loch Dhu when it was still available. This whiskey, on the other hand, is overpriced about $80 in Washington D.C.) and over-rated. The peat flavor was overpowering - and it tasted less like peat than artificial smoke. The whiskey tasted far too young, very rough, no depth or real scotch character. I drank a few ounces over the course of this week, and finally could take no more. For the first time in my life I poured a whiskey down the sink. A waste of money, but really no use trying to drink the undrinkable.",
            "I like this pump pretty well. My only complaint is that for the thicker syrup (chocolate) that I have it doesn't always want to pump the syrup very well. The issue is that the chocolate dries at the end of the spout after a day or so and when you go to start pumping it again it's very slow and difficult. It's a mild annoyance, but I do wish I had gotten one that was just a bit bigger.",

            "This delectable brew always reminds me of eating in a Chinese restaurant where this black tea is served, rivaling in popularity with green tea. The taste is smooth and mellow, absolutely delicious with some sugar and even tastier when chilled. There is no harshness and no aftertaste and this would please even the most finicky tea drinkers. I used to make two or three cups of it, and leave them in the kitchen only to return later to drink the cool, silky tea. Also wonderful with milk or lemon, this black tea is my second favorite after The Prince of Wales also from Twinings and even though they are both black teas, they taste little differently. Oolong is my everyday drinking tea but it's delicious enough to be served to guests or to sip a steaming mug of it on a rainy afternoon.<br /><br />I have tried other brands of Oolong, but so far this is the gentles and less metallic and smoky tasting than others. I am drinking it now with some fried rice as I type, and in my mind I am ready to have a refill or two. For those still stuck on Lipton and Tetley this is the tea they need to change to, for the price is not high and the taste is absolutely fantastic. This is one tea not to be missed, as it's delicate and smooth, and so much more than just  tea .<br /><br />- Kasia S.",

The Italian Herb-flavored variety is a little  busier  to my taste.  Although I haven't tried them with a glass of wine, I'm sure they would be a BIG hit at a party where wine is served.  I enjoy them all by themselves, slowly savoring the flavor, chewing small bites to make them last longer!  Also, it's possible the batch of Italian Herb-flavored Parmesan crisps I received might be a little stale, affecting my enjoyment of them, as opposed to what seemed like a fresher batch of Rosemary-flavored Parmesan Crisps.  At any rate, my first choice is the Rosemary-flavored Parmesan Crisps!",

I must admit they are very tasty (especially the veggie flavor)<br />So I've been searching for an adult rice cracker thats similar.<br />These crackers were close. They are just too thick. Thats the only problem. If they were 1/2 or even 2/3 as thick they would be better. The flavor is sort of soy saucey. Its a good flavor. But i'm still searching for an adult rice cracker as good as a Baby Mumum (but hopefully less expensive by oz)",
            "As someone who does not eat sugar and avoids most artificial sweeteners (like aspartame), I've had a hard time finding a tasty and effective breath mint.  I was so happy when I found Myntz.  Not only are the sugar free, but the sorbitol sweetener is actually good for dental health.  I like the touch of vanilla in this flavor; it smooths out the bite of the mint.  They do the job on my coffee breath, too!",

If they made frozen dough using the same recipe I could have pizza with near zero carbs also.  They need to franchise this product and recipe on the East Coast by this baker.",

Nice chewy texture without being tough.",

I'm ok with it because I keep reminding myself that, while I'm not getting the wonderful taste of the original, I'm also not getting the kick of caffeine that comes with the original spice tea. It helps to give it plenty of steeping time and make sure the water is hot enough.",

I would have to say its not my favorite gluten-free product, but if you like eating  muffin tops and have a problem with gluten, there really isn't anything else out there like it.<br /><br />However, if you want real chocolate taste and a fine texture, then I'd try the gluten-free brownies by French Meadow.  Cold right out of the freezer or heated up in the microwave.<br /><br />When I heated up this muffin top in the microwave, it just wasn't as good and wasn't really much more than a single mouthful.<br /><br />Hey, Udis...I like your other stuff, so please go back to the drawing board and add more chocolate?",
            "I like dried fruits, both as a snack and as an item to pack with my noontime work lunches. Plus, I almost always take them along when I go on camping trips. Nutritionally, they offer almost all the advantages of fresh fruit, but they don't require refrigeration and have a long shelf life if the bag seal is maintained. Typically, I buy the dried fruits in large bags and dole them out in smaller portions from there.<br /><br />Yesterday, I was in my favorite warehouse store and found a large bag (22 ounces) of Kirkland Signature Dried Mangoes and Cherries. Mmmmm, That ought to be good. Two different kinds of mangoes and two different kinds of cherries. Well, they're delicious! Nice mix of flavors. Fresh and chewy with a nice sweet and fruity taste. Yum! These won't last long!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",

            "If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The  I Love You  chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R�verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",
            "I've loved the taste of bubblegum since I was a kid, but I don't need all the sugar that is in bubblegum and so have avoided it for the most part, as an adult.  I was happy to see that my favorite brand had a sugar-free variety and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />For sweetening, it uses five different artificial sweeteners: sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, aspertame, and acesulfame potassium.  There are 3 grams of sugar alcohols in one piece, which seems like a lot.<br /><br />The taste seems very much like the original, sugar-sweetened product.  The pieces strike me as being a little smaller than the original.  I have not tried blowing any bubbles, but I suspect one would need more than one piece for that.  Like the sugar-sweetened version, the flavor does not last very long but, unlike the original, once the flavor has worn out, there seems to be a vague, off-putting, somewhat-sour flavor left behind -- the only reason I dropped a star on the rating.<br /><br />Being that it is sold here in packs of 12-boxes, I will be chewing for awhile.  It doesn't quite make me feel like a kid again, but I am enjoying it like I did as a kid.",

Not only does this product contain 20 grams of protein & taste great, but it is great to eat as a snack or when you are on the go. The only downfall is that the product sells out very quickly so I would suggest you buy 2-3 boxes at a time to be on the safe side.",

However, as a plethora of tea varieties claimed shelf space in the tea section, Darjeeling has become increasingly difficult to find. As a dedicated Darjeeling fan, this became exasperating.

In the picture they look like white Hello Kitty's wearing pink and red clothes, however the ones I recieved are yellow Hello Kitty's wearing red and blue clothes, and the ones wearing red have yellow bows in there hair, which I didn't like. I know its just candy but I am having a pink and red themed Hello Kitty party so having the colors off was important. I have no idea how these taste, but they are basically pure sugar so I am sure the kids will like them.",

            "When Jesus saved all of the holy mesiah from drowning by making Noah build a giant boat, he must have messed up and let pistachios on the boat.  Who creates such a pecular object?  The ackward shell on the outside hiding the hidious greenish brown nut on the inside.  This is the nerd of the nut family people.  Then some of them the shell doesnt have that little helper crack to make it easy to peel.  Then you have to bite it or something and get shells in your mouth.  Its horriable that a nut could be deemed livable, we should all band together and rid the world of pistachios.  Maybe if they called it something cooler i would have different views on it.  How about calling it  The Evil Nut From Hell That's Color Is Best Described As Breen, A Mix Of Brown And Green , then i would have no problem with it.  If we all band together this fantasy could become a reality.  maybe well call it tenfhtcibdabamobag for short.<br /><br />Actually now that i think of it, I love pistachios and the name.  Disregard everything I had just stated and go eat some NOW.",
            "If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />We miss shakes and ice cream and this is a good flavor to use to make such a treat. Put one to two tablespoons of this flavoring into a blender add 6 to 8 ounces of skim milk, a couple of tablespoons of vanilla sugar free pudding, and � cup of crushed ice. Blend this until smooth and you have a good tasting dietetic fruit smoothie that makes a good snack.  It tastes like a dreamsicle. You can even freeze this and have a sort of dreamsicle ice cream treat. We also used to add in a vanilla protein mix that we would add into one of these to make a light meal.  You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!",

Showed up in 3 days.<br />The salt has undertones of clay, which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe.  The liquid smoke overpowered it, but the flavor was there.  I think it best used as a rub or finishing salt.<br />There is also black Hawaiian salt... somehow mixed in with lava!  Have to try that next...<br />P.S.  The salt was well packaged in a jar.",

It isn't your traditional hot sauce, as it has a mustard base, but it goes well on everything from hotdogs and hamburgers to deli sandwiches and fish.  The scotch bonnet peppers give it a nice sweet taste, and then a bit of heat, but not overwhelming.  Since being introduced to this sauce a few years ago, I have always kept at least two bottles on hand, and any time I place an order for more, I have to call all of my friends to see if they need to restock.  Try this sauce!  It is amazing.",

One problem is that they don't do well in humidity, turning into a solid mass.<br /><br />That fact will make it hard to buy a six-pack from here. Unless you live in Arizona or in a permanently climate-controlled house, you do not want to keep this product too long on the shelf. If it cakes, we have found that you can open the bottom of the container, place the product in a blender and make it usable.",

            "This wonderful stuff has made such a difference for both our dogs.  We have used it for about 4 years. Our younger dog frequently had runny stools - the vet often put him on powerful anti-biotics for the diahrea.  Since I started adding a tablespoon of this to all his meals, he can eat anything (including raw meat) with no loose stools, ever! (My dogs are currently eating primarily a fresh food diet that I prepare.) A vet suggested Wysong C-biotic for the pro-biotics, but I believe it also has digestive enzymes that our dog may have been missing. Our older dog had terrible allergies. She was on a variety of meds and even received regular allergy shots.  Adding this to her meals made a significant difference.  It didn't make sense to me, but her old vet (who is not very holistic) said it made perfect sense.  The immune system is based in the gut, and it is the immune system that goes haywire and creates allergies.  Getting the old dog's digestive track working better helped her immune system work more normally. (Not to say her allergies are gone, but it is as helpful as many of the other things we do for her.)  The dogs love the taste of it too!",
            "I've used and loved this product for a long time.  It's a great pick-me-up for the afternoon!  But the shipping price--not so nice.  I've found another resource where I can buy multiple items from Germany, including the coffee, and the shipping rarely exceeds $20 for a large box of goodies because the company packs everything and then weighs.  It doesn't charge by the item.",
            "cool idea but the item was poorly packaged and the cover of the set was stained with spices that had leaked out of their containers. Since this is a food item, it should have been completely sealed and not only were the individual spice containers not sealed, but the box came in a non-sealed plastic bag. Also, the kit was a bit smaller than I was anticipating (I guess not entirely a bad thing) AND the ratio of mixed spices (like  italian seasoning ,  mexican seasoning , etc) to pure spices was a little dissapointing - I would have liked to get more pure spices.",

Instead of Xs, all food pellets are now shaped like discs (like pill capsules). My cats like this shape better but they don't chew their food now, which causes lots of vomiting. I've tried to discourage it by putting golf balls in their food but I think I'm just going to switch to another brand.",

I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!",

            "As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying  fresh  truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.",

He and his friends enjoyed the novelty, and all agreed (he shared) it tasted good.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be buying it again soon. Great as a novelty present, but a bit expensive (to me, especially when considering shipping) for an everyday lunchbox item.",

My kids (8,6 and 3) are pretty picky, so I was worried they would reject these.  They love them and we have already devoured the first 2 boxes!  Highly recommend!",
            "While without any doubt I give the Werther's original and caramel chews a big 5, this candy doesn't really fit the bill at all.  For starters, the description on Amazon is totally misleading  Werther's Original Original Creamy Caramel Filled Bag  made me believe I was ordering the caramels, then to my dismay it was the hard candy with caramel filling.  Fortunately Amazon was very charitable and offered a refund given the truly needed change to the description.<br /><br />Besides this, the hard candy which is just a brittle shell mixed with a version of the caramel, but doesn't taste at all like the caramel chews, was very disappointing as I had actually tried the new candy from two bags purchased at my pharmacy.  The brittle shell really tastes nothing like the hard candy either making it feel like your eating hard candy while chewing gum.  What possessed Werther's to go this route is a bit of a mystery to me since their current tried and true products are perfect.",

They informed me that the product was now out of stock and they would ship it as soon as it became available.  Meanwhile, I had run out of dog food that morning.  After cancelling my order, I purchased this item from Wag.com around 3:30pm on a Tuesday.  I received notification just a few hours later that the item had shipped, and received it the next day around 10am (despite the fact that we live the next state over - - shipped from PA to NY).  Less than 24 hours turnaround time for only $4.99 shipping!  Totally worth it.  Product was packaged well and arrived in great condition.  And did I mention, in less than 24 hours?!?!  I'll be buying from Wag.com again.  :]",

            "Disclaimer: I'm a huge tea-drinker and tea-lover! However, I don't like teas that are too bitter or astringent-tasting.<br /><br />Puerh tea (pronounced  POO-air ) can be either green or black, which is really confusing. This one in particular is a green that tastes like a black! Puerh must be gathered from very old tea plants, which is partly why it tends to be quite expensive. Puerhs are supposed to be very strong-tasting, but this one is relatively mild.<br /><br />This Magnolia Puerh tastes very, very floral, almost like a jasmine, but is also very mild. It steeps up light, so don't over-steep thinking it needs to darken and turn it bitter. (Any tea will bitter if over-steeped due to the tannins.) The mouth-feel is light and silky, and it's very floral and aromatic. I do not agree with the product description that the flavor  changes with every sip , but it does take on a very faint citrusy flavor if you let it sit for 10 minutes before drinking. It is only enhanced by honey and milk.<br /><br />If you like Jasmine tea, you would be very likely to enjoy Numi's Magnolia Puerh tea. It's also a good choice for someone who loves black and floral, and wants to gradually ease into drinking more greens.",
            "I bought this tea without reading any reviews or any knowledge of the Ceylon Tea Company and I'm happy I did.<br />First off, the price is very reasonable for a tea from Sri Lanka. Second, free shipping is offered for this product, reducing the cost even more. But the most important point about this tea is the taste, that is why I'm writing this review.<br />When I opened the package, the smell of bergamot and tea was great. The bags come in a foil package inside of a box, they are not individually wrapped. I boiled (not quite a boil... probably around 200 degrees) up some water and let the tea bag sit for 3 minutes. What I got was very aromatic, nice and dark and the taste was outstanding. What a treat. I have tried different steep times, and really, this tea is hard to mess up.<br />I highly recommend this Earl Grey and will definitely buy again.",

From Amazon. Because my local grocery store didn't have them. And I nearly cried in the aisle because of that little tragic fact. Yeah.<br /><br />I've never had Mallomars before. They're wonderful. They're soft and delicate, and the little internal cookie is so deliciously spongy.

I'm especially pleased that this cracker has no corn either.<br /><br />I have eaten this product for over 4 months now and it consistently is superb so all I can say is I hope they don't tinker with the recipe because I can't imagine a better gluten free cracker.",

            "We pack these for trips into the backcountry. When you're out for several days, these little club 'n cheddars taste pretty good. They pack too many calories for us to keep them around the house, but when you're burning 3,000-4,000 KCalories per day on the trail, you need to carry things that are calorie dense and tasty. This fits the bill. Check your store for the similar Doritos jalapeno cheese crackers to add a little kick if you prefer.",
            "Saw item on Amazon was looking for something not to big or too small for hubbys kurig coffee pods. This arrived in only a few days and fits perfectly on the counter with the coffee maker. It holds enough coffee to keep you in coffe for a couple weeks depending on your intake that is. It's made of metal and also has enough room on top for your two large size coffee cups. Would recomend this product to anyone looking for a place for your kurig pods. Neat and size is perfect for small areas.",
            "Do you like cloves?  Wish you could make clove tea and bathe in it?  Taste nothing but cloves and clove-y goodness all the time?  Then you will LOVE this 'tea'.<br /><br />If, however, you were expecting a tea flavor, with hints of peach and a mulling spice type of flavor, this is not what you want.  There is no hint of anything, just the sensation of your senses of taste and smell being hammered into submission by cloves.<br /><br />Nicely packaged, good price, makes a good potpourri if you don't want to drink any after that first sip.  Or I guess you could sprinkle a little on your Christmas ham before you bake it, I'll try some of their other teas but not if they are labeled as 'spiced'.",
            "For many years we depended on this bean soup mix on wilderness backpacking trips, and then our local stores stopped carrying it. I'm very happy to discover that I can buy it from Amazon, and it's still exactly the same product that we knew and loved.<br /><br />It's a versatile mix that combines well with other dried foods such as rice, sun dried tomatoes, or bacon bits. By varying the amount of water, you can make a nourishing hot soup for a cold, wet day, or a dip to enjoy with tortilla chips from the last town at the edge of the big woods.<br /><br />I used to cook it with McCormick dried soup vegetables that we bought in the spice aisle at the grocery store, but that product has disappeared as well. So for my test run tonight, I substituted Harmony House Foods Dried Vegetable Soup Mix.

            "We have been buying this garlic ramano sprinkle for over 10 years, amazingly I found it here for much less money, shipping only took a couple of days. If you like garlic bread you gotta give this a try. You can spend up to $5.00 on a little tiny bottle at the grocery store but why, shelf life on this is a long time we have never had one go bad..",
            "I bought this from their online site last year.  It's a wonderful product.  I use it mainly for skin and hair.  Smells great like fresh coconuts. Not overly greasy like baby oil.  Solid at cooler temperatures so bring the jar in the bathroom with you so that it heats up after your shower and pour it into a squeeze bottle (ketchup bottles works well).  Apply after bathing like you would any bath oil.  My skin is moist and smells yummy.  Also can be used as anti-frizz hair serum.<br />I almost bought another brand on amazon because of free shipping, but glad I didn't because other brands come in plastic jars.  I think glass jars keeps better.  The oil I bought a year ago still smells the same.  And if you buy at their site, you'll sometimes come across special offers like buy one get one free.  Also, their site has interesting info such as why there's no such thing as extra virgin coconut oil.  I bought several jars and gave one to my mom and my best friend's mom.  That's how much I love this stuff.  Just bought 6 more jars today so I won't run out.  Planning to give away some jars to friends too.",

            "I have never worked with fondant before. I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this. However, in my opinion I had a great first time experience. The fondant was easy to roll out and I was able to cover the cake in one easy move. I found that it was enough fondant to cover two 9 in cake rounds with some extra fondant left over to make some ball decorations around the cake. I thought it tasted great and was a pleasant coffee flavor. I would recommend fondarific fondant to others. Just wish the other flavors were cheaper like the coffee mocha flavor.",
            "Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!",
            "I haven't owned a dog in over 25 years but I got a puppy in November 2010.  She was rescued (with her brother) because her mother was killed by a coyote.  The woman who rescued her hand fed the puppies with bottles.  When they started eating she put them on Science Diet.  I have read some pretty nasty comments about Science Diet in the reviews.  I agree with a guy that wrote that the results from feeding Science Diet speak for themselves.  My pet is perfectly healthy, full of energy, her stools are just right, and her coat is very shiny.  I guess it would be better if I could afford to have dog food made from products humans would eat. People seem to rave about these dog foods made from all healthy almost human consumable ingredients.  As my puppy is doing so well on this food, I am choosing to leave her with it till adulthood.  Then I will may shop for another brand.  As they say, why fix it if it ain't broke!",

Our dog kept having acid reflux to a number of other foods containing meals....so to avoid this we tried Spring Naturals on a hunch. Since then, our dog no longer experiences any of the gastric issues that plagued her. It is worth mentioning that you should shop around here on Amazn for different vendors considering I've seen dramatic swings in prices depending on who the seller is. Overall a good food that  is well balanced, and good for your dog, I should finally mention that her cost has visibly improved as well.",

            "My whole family--especially the eight-year-old--loves these wide rice noodles (chow fun). They are not easy to find outside of a Chinese market, so buying in bulk is a good idea. I love the mouth-feel of rice noodles anyway, and wide is just that much more fun. Plus, they are not flimsy (like rice vermicelli), so are easy to stir-fry. I use a simple Cantonese style, with some soy sauce, some oyster sauce, and a little beef stock. Be sure to use plenty of oil when you stir-fry, as the noodles do absorb it. But your dish will be so beautiful, it's so worth it. Lastly, if you are on a no-gluten diet, you are gonna go ga-ga over these!<br /><br />The directions on the package for presoaking are good--but instead of warm tap water (which has more lead in it from the pipes!) use cold water and warm it in the microwave. Be sure your noodle container is large enough so that the noodles won't stick to each other too much (and you will have to stir from time to time--again, to keep them from sticking). If you have to do something else, you can store the partially softened, drained noodles in the fridge--they'll be fine when you get back. Then saute as usual. Serve quickly so that the noodles don't get mushy. Voila! A fabulous and easy meal with minimal work (just a little advance effort).",
            "There is no question that there hasn't been competition for marshmellow squares snacks that has drove to withstand Rice Krispies Treats. But for Pebbles cereals, they are the latest to enter that snack arena, and they have a not bad challenge, with Cocoa Pebbles Treats. They taste good, but honestly when I got a chance to try them, they actually were very small in the box, compared to the big bars Rice Krispies hve had in the candy store. Not only that, but also they didn't look like they were crumbled up in pieces either. Nevertheless, Pebbles Treats aren't bad for a change of pace. Still, I do absolutely wish that they could make a bigger version for snacking on. It is worth a try overall though.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-",

There is just enough breadcrumbs to help bind the crabcake together and just enough seasonings to not overpower the flavor of the crabmeat.

            "I eat mine mashed on buttered toast with fresh black pepper. These are medium fish, running 5 per tin, in good condition, tender but not quite mushy. These are my first hot-sauce sardines. The spicy hot sauce almost overwhelms the taste of the fish, so I'd say this is more of a protein/hot-sauce experience than a sardine snack. Luckily, they're not too salty. The sauce is very spicy for a mass consumer product, but for dedicated heat/pain folks, I'm sure these fishies will be almost mild. Frankly, I was surprised by how decent these fish were for the price compared to some of the other cut-rate sardines I've tried. When I need a change from my usual sardines in tomato sauce, I'll reach for these guys. Heck, I had a positive enough experience that I'm looking forward to trying other brands of hot-sauce fish.",

I highly recommend this powder as it has very good heat level; provided you don't mind extra work.<br /><br />They put rice, thoroughly intermixed with powder from top to bottom to prevent caking, which I appreciate.  The shaker lid has holes too large in diameter, allowing the rice to fall out.  Thus, you must use a small mesh strainer to separate the rice and powder; which I strongly dislike.<br /><br />I thought the rice might not be long grain, so I tested the lid with long grain rice.  The holes need to be reduced to half original diameter to prevent the rice from falling out.  If they fixed this obvious design error, 5 star.",

            "I was very happy to find this product on amazon.com.  I have been looking in stores for a long time and could not find it.  Will order again.",
            "I couldn't imagine why there was no sodium free VEGETABLE broth. I finally found some and it is good. So convenient to use, rather that boiling up a batch yourself and throwing in frozen cubes.I am doing a lot of from scratch cooking and even canning with this low sodium diet and really didn't need one more thing to make.",
            "While they have a few mustards to choose from I picked this one solely as a dare, to the Fallot people, to disappoint me.  I've had their Dijon and their Dijon with Peppercorn so I knew that they knew what they were doing.  When I saw the Gingerbread variant I figured it was the LEAST appealing.  For me that is always a sign of a way to expand my horizons so I went for it.  It is excellent.  The more detailed ingredients include wheat and spices.  It's not the gingerbread taste I was expecting, which is a good thing.  It is dijon with a very unique zip to it.  I put it on ham with a whole grain wheat bread.  I prefer high tech ingredients like Boar's Head rosemary & sundried tomato ham but it's too delicate for this particular mustard so just use a basic high quality meat.  Serve it to yourself though, unless you know someone who is a total  foodie.   I paired it(LOL) with a French beverage in the form of a Citadelle gin martini.  Look to the French for food and art and you won't be disappointed,",
            "These aren't bad, they're just as advertised. But I feel like it would be worth it to just learn how to make your own, I think I will look into it.",
            "I love these biscottis. They are 15 calories each and taste wonderful. Because there are so few calories these falls under a diet product which means they aren't cheap. However I got them here for about 30% less than the other vendor I used online.",
            "When I picked up a box of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B00474OR8G >Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!",
            "Great taste and freshness.  We go through a lot of pepper and won't use the pre-ground stuff.  Definitely recommend these.  Great for pepper crusted salmon, vinaigrettes, or other recipes where you count on good pepper.",
            "Seems to be holding up to claims that it lasts longer than regular chews, which is good since it's pretty expensive. My dog took to it right away, and as long as she doesn't lose interest before too long, I plan on getting more!",
            "My kitty eats all the flavors of Natural Balance Platefulls on rotation, and loves all of them equally. He gets dry food in the morning, and a pouch for dinner every night. His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad breath like some other canned/pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables. To my surprise, the bowl was licked clean! And after 3 months, he still licks the bowl clean every night!",
            "Arrived very fresh and taste. A bit expensive for the amount delivered, but worth while as a gift. Found a similar product at local Kroger store which was not quite as good but much cheaper by the pound.",
            "This spice was pungent, spicy, and flavorful. You'll be able to taste that fruity and sweet habanero flavor along with that top-tier spicy kick. Use with care.",
            "Great exploding watermelon flavor!! Even though it loses it's flavor very fast, its classic Bubblicious gum! Very nice packaging and shipping was fast like always. Well done!",
            "This coffee is sooo good!  I was worried it would have an artificial taste and I usually don't like flavored coffee.  But I do like the pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks and I was hoping this would be similar.  It is even better!  It has a great pumpkin pie spice taste and when you add half and half and splenda it tastes like a dessert. It is a really good treat for a cold day.",
            "Quaker Oats may not be the most exciting thing I could review, but it's so incredibly good for your health that I decided to submit this review anyway. Oatmeal has apparently been around in one form or another for goodness knows how long; and the Quaker Oats brand of oatmeal is probably the best you can buy.<br /><br />The oatmeal is easy to make; you can make it on the stovetop with either milk or water (water is healthier); alternatively you can prepare it in the microwave as I do. There are instructions for stovetop cooking on the packaging. If you want to make it in the microwave, pour a serving (1/2 cup dry) into a bowl, add some water until you're satisfied with the amount of water in the bowl and just pop it into the microwave. I find that 2 � minutes in the microwave makes a great hot breakfast that's very healthy for me; and that's doubly important for me as I am on a very strict diet. I must lower my weight and cholesterol to avoid even more health problems that I already have. Sigh.<br /><br />The oatmeal has a slight amount of fat; the total fat is 3 grams per serving. There is no cholesterol; and there's no sodium which makes this a better choice than Cheerios if you're watching your sodium intake. The dietary fiber is relatively high; there are 4 grams of dietary fiber per serving.<br /><br />If you have any questions about just how much oatmeal you need in your own specific diet, ask your doctor. Sometimes eating extra oatmeal--for example, having two portions instead of one every morning--doesn't necessarily mean you're getting twice the value of this product. Again, please ask your doctor or nutritionist to be sure.<br /><br />In addition, the containers usually last a little over a year--look at the packaging for the expiration date and eat the oatmeal before that time.<br /><br />Overall, this oatmeal by Quaker Oats is just about the healthiest choice for your daily breakfast or any other time you wish to eat it.<br /><br />Enjoy!",
            "I was very pleased by the ingredient list and the quality of this chocolate. It retains the benefits of being a superfood without the worry if the other ingredients will offset the nutrition you are getting from the chocolate.<br /><br />Very smooth and pleasant taste, not overly candy tasting. Perfect blend of tadte and nutition. These bars are a bit high on the price scale at roughly 5 a piece, but you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I originally ordered them for valentines day, but have reordered since at the request of my girlfriend who is a chocoholic.",
            "The product arrived earlier than I expected and was exactly what my husband was looking for. I would order again from this site.",
            "I've worked with different types of fondants and if you are reading reviews because you are new to the Fondant Cake process, here are some things to keep in mind:<br />1. Satin Ice is Yummier than most<br />2. Satin Ice is harder to work with than many<br />3. Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;)<br /><br />I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving. If you are new to cake-ing I would recommend using Wilton's the first few times to get the hang of things before moving to the more finicky fondants. If you start by using this fondant, you may be Freudianly misspronouncing it in a loud voice:  I hate you SATAN Ice!!  Really, fondant tears may stain your cheeks.<br /><br />Fondants I've used in order of easiest to work with:<br />1. Wilton's<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. Homemade Marshmallow<br /><br />Fondant's I've worked with in order of yummieness:<br />1. Homemade Marshmallow<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. (distantly) Wilton's<br /><br />I would recommend the tutorial on Satin Ice website, really great:<br />[...]<br /><br />If you are only buying Satin Ice to sculpt edible animals, than this would be a great one. For first time cake coverings, try Wilton's, get things down then come back to Satin Ice.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and good luck on your cake adventures!<br />Jackie<br />domesticfits (dot)  com",
            "Our family was pleasantly surprised by this mix - it tastes as good as the fair, plus the cost for 1 box equals what we pay for just 1 cake!  This was our family's 1st attempt at funnel cakes, but it was VERY easy & VERY tasty - just add water & pour batter into hot grease ... cook til golden brown & sprinkle with powdered sugar. Our 13-yr old actually made them (with supervision) & our family of 5 ate them up. This was a good price too, a little less than grocery store. We'll be back for more!",
            "I'm a huge fan of Republic of Tea teas, but this one was way too much.  The smell of the tea brings me back to how the house used to smell when my grandpa smoked pipes. Its not a bad smell like cigarettes, but it also isn't the type of smell you want to drink either. I asked some coworkers to smell it too, and they all mentioned old men or smoking. They also would not drink a cup when I offered!<br /><br />Luckily, when the tea is brewed, it doesn't taste as strong as it smells, but there is a lot of Roobios in there and I guess I'm not a huge fan of that either.  I've only been able to get through two cups of this tea and I did feel a little 'charged' afterward - the stuff is strong - but I think you've got to be a fan of really bold, tobacco-like flavors to get into this tea.",
            "I have tried several and always find it a challenge to find one you can enjoy that is reasonably priced and delicious. I got turned on to this brand from a local health food store in PA.<br /><br />I absolutely love it! It doesn't taste like it's from a can, it's a large can and it'a bout 100 calories per can, so refreshing!!! What a grea find!

            "very small, much smaller than i expected and i measured it, it either is wrong or dimensions were wrong.Would not recommend at all.",
            "excellent quality and taste! a real bargain if tou can store contents in sealed refrigersted container to ensure flavor freshness.",
            "I picked up one of these packets locally to try it for the first time.  Like most seasoning packets, it is going to carry a fairly significant amount of salt (10% of your RDA, according to the U.S. Nutrition Facts information), but that's about it as far as dangers from this packet are concerned.  The labeling (all in German) claims this packet makes 4 portions--but they're very generous portions; our family of 3 had more than enough to satisfy everyone, and enough left over for lunch the next day.<br /><br />Basic directions (again, in German) are printed on the back, to wit: cut a pound of meat (beef, pork or poultry) into cubes and brown in hot oil.  Add about 1 1/2 c. water, bring to a boil, add contents of the packet and return to boil.  Cover, turn to low and cook 60-90 minutes, or until meat is tender.  (Or cook in a 400 degree F oven.)  Serve with potatoes.<br /><br />Each packet also offers another recipe; ours had  Budapest-style  goulash on the back.  Here's how that one goes: cut about a pound of pork stew meat into cubes and brown them in oil.  Add a generous 1 1/2 c. water and the contents of the goulash spice packet.  Bring to a boil, cover, turn to low and cook for about an hour.<br /><br />In a separate pan, cook about 2 ounces bacon until crisp.  Drain off nearly all the fat, then add two chopped onions and two chopped bell peppers (red and/or green) to the pan.  Saute for 10 minutes, or until the onions start to take on some color.  Add these to the main pan along with 2 or 3 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced (or use whole canned tomatoes, cut up), and cook another 10 minutes.<br /><br />We served this goulash over rice.  The original called for it to be served with potato dumplings, which would also be excellent.",

            "The dehydrated blueberries that I usually purchase were unavailable, so I looked for a substitute that was  just blueberries , nothing else listed on the ingredients.  This item appeared to meet that criteria.  Unfortunately, when the product arrived, it was not only berries, but also oil and sweetener.  Instead of plumping up when rehydrated in my morning milk, they did not change at all.  They were much more a sweet snack than a true blueberry flavor.  If you are looking for a  sweetened blueberry with oil  snack, this might be for you, but if you are looking for  dried fruit  as in dehydrated fruit, this is definitely not it.",
            "I experimented with more than 10 places on Amazon for Darjeeling first flush and settled with Tao of Tea. Highly recommend for the price. I have been drinking this tea for more than one year. Decent quality for the price. The down side is that the tea seems to be not from any single tea estate and therefore the quality varies from batch to batch.",
            "The previous reviewer is clearly confused.  An  extract  is the essence of the plant or fruit (orange, in this case), mixed with alcohol.  No alcohol, no extract.<br /><br />That said, this extract is excellent and an astonishing bargain at its current price of $6.99.<br /><br />The aroma is pleasant and, not surprisingly, smells just like oranges.<br /><br />It adds delightful orange flavor to any dish.  I made lemon poppy seed bread for Christmas and, instead of putting all lemon extract, put half lemon and half orange extract.  Every single person who ate the bread said it was the best they ever had.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the confused and uninformed reviewer, this orange extract is excellent.",
            "I am from the Midwest and lived in the South for 21 yrs, moved back to the Midwest. I fell in love with this product and cannot live without it in my life. No other mayo is the same. I have it shipped to my house since I am unable to find it here. Love it!",
            "I decided to purchase this balsamic after reading a few good reviews.<br /><br />From what I heard from a few people, I expected much more.  This is a watery vinegar and does not cling to your food like the better balsamics. I put a couple drops on some cheese and they instantly rolled off onto the plate. It's also much more sour than I expected.  The bottle should have a smaller opening as it drips down the side and pours out too quickly.  I'd recommend ripping out the plastic piece and dumping it in a cruet.<br /><br />It is smooth as some others have said and does not leave a bad aftertaste.  I think I'll save this for cooking and dressing rather than drizzling on food.  I imagine it would make a good reduction.  It does make a decent vinaigrette as I mixed it with olive oil and had a salad for breakfast this morning.  You don't need a lot.<br /><br />It's simply not up to par with better balsamics that work well with eveything. I'm partial to thicker, sweeter balsamics, so take that as you will.  If you like thinner, tangier balsamics then this may be for you.  I'd consider this more of a recipe ingredient than a condiment.<br /><br />The Amazon price is also on the high side.  You can currently get two bottles of this exact product on eBay for $12.",

            "Although not exactly as I remember raisin bread, it's a welcome treat after so long without. It has a good texture, toasts well, but could have more cinnamon flavor. It is somewhat pricey, but I miss bread, so I splurge a little.<br /><br />Update: I need to warn consumers that, although this packaging should last until the expiration date, you must examine this bread before you use it. At $44+ you can't eat this bread too fast, even though it is light. As I got to the last three loaves, I noticed mold on most of the slices. I hoped none was tainted that was already eaten. It was well before the expiration date. I now have too much of a distrust of this product to order it again. The Ener_G company took the bad bread back and will send me replacement loaves. They asked why I didn't order from them. From now on, I think i will. It can't be any more expensive. This price is no bargain.",
            "Imbued with a signature hoppiness and a 9.5% ABV that numbs the senses, this triple golden ale is one of many excellent brews associated with the Victory brewing company.  If I was going to eat a meal with this ale, I would probably chose a spicy chicken Thai or Indian dish.  This is an excellent American microbrew worthy of praise.  Moreover, at $7 for a 750 ml corked bottle, you can't go wrong!  Highly recommended...",

She took some to work for a brown bag lunch even.<br /><br />It was easy to make: just add water, stir and put the mix into a pan (I used a large iron skillet). The cornbread was ready in 25 minutes - they suggest you check on it after 20 minutes. I will probably try the other mixes.",

My dad did grow up on the island of Santa Maria (Azores) so may be used to a more  robust  sausage.",

            "The producted passed the kid test and cooks well if you prepare al dente and finish off with the sauce.  If you over cook will taste like paste.  Be careful and watch the pasta and you will love it.  Amazon should monitor the cost and I don't mind paying for the convenance of delivery but 3 x the cost of the item sold in most stores was crazy.",

            "This is a single 16.9oz bottle of first press extra virgin olive oil.  Mine arrived with one of those olive oil dispenser nozzles like you see at salad bars.  I am not planning to use it every day, so I pour from the bottle, which drips a little without having one of those internal dripless plastic inserts.  The flavor is great.  The aroma is fairly mild.  I probably won't buy again as it is $23 for 33 tablespoons of olive oil, a little out of my comfort range for how much to spend on food items for me.  But it was nice to try, and many people rave about this olive oil.",

I love it so much that I bought one for the lake, and now for my office where they are taking away our Keurig because it isn't  green .  The melitta uses coffee pods, which don't have all the packaging that other single coffee makers have.  You can also use the one:one without a pod to make hot chocolate for the kids (or yourself!).  I highly recommend it.  I bought a replacement maker that I keep in the basement, just in case my original pot dies - so far - it just keeps going and going - so it is durable as well!",

I am homebound and ordering the dog food can be pricey, so occasionally I try another high quality brand, but he won't even give it a try...well maybe a bite...but then he sits down and looks at me like 'okay, is this a joke, where's the good stuff?'...it may cost a little more, but he is worth it and earns every bite!",
            "I am on a restricted diet where I cannot eat any gluten.  Crackers have been a real problem.  What a nice surprise to find these Sesmark Rice Thins.  I have enjoyed the sesame flavor for awhile now and just discovered the cheddar flavor.  Both yummy!",

It makes a better gift than the traditional bottle of wine when going to someone's  house for dinner. That's how I discovered it. It is hard to find in stores but easy to find on Amazon. The first that I had came from a fiend who brought it from France.",

            "The ginger flavor is a bit too subtle for me and it's overwhelmed by sweetness. I think most people would like this balance, but I'm looking for more of a  bite  in my ginger candy. The texture is a little unusual - one reviewer described it like those valentine candy hearts, and I'd say that's pretty accurate. They dissolve a little too quickly in my opinion. I probably wouldn't buy these again.",
            "Bee venom was used by the Egyptians thousands of years ago for various ailments, A friend recently brought back Manuka Honey with Glucosamine & Bee Venom for me to try, Bee Venom releases Cortisone & Hydrocortisone in the body, helping to heal and making one feel fantastic. Glucosamine, although wonderful in helping rebuild Cartilage, tends to also increase Cholesterol but that might be in much larger doses. I have never felt this good in my life, I started with an 1/8 of a teaspoon but was able to increase it to a full teaspoon in about 3 weeks. I recently bought 3 additional jars and have started my 2nd one last week. Bee Venom can sometimes have an effect on one's blood pressure, causing it to rise but in my case, I just lessened the amount I was taking and things got back to normal quickly. I test my blood pressure daily, just to be on the safe side. My Father, his wife & my wife are currently also taking Manuka Honey with Glucosamine & Bee Venom.",

I even bought some pineapple juice to mix with the papaya concentrate and it's pretty darn tasty.",

The flavor is so much better than any of the others I can't even remember one that came close and the consistency isn't gum.  There are actually pieces of beans that you can see, feel, and teast when you eat it.  It's so good you can eat it alone (I do) and it adds to any of your recipes requiring refried black beans.  Try them!",
            "I was extremely disappointed on receipt of this item.  It came very poorly packaged and therefore arrived in a very unappealing way.  All of the nice decorations had fallen off and were crumbled.  The whole idea of the cake, was to be delicious and decorative for the holidays.  It could not be served in the condition in which it was received, unfortunately.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin however, the vendor did replace the item with another product of the same value, so I appreciated that.",

            "This is actually a pretty good tasting aloe concentrate mix. It has a slight 'herb-y' taste from the various herbs and stuff they put in, but overall it is a nice refreshing tasting concentrate. I just pour a capful into a glass of water for a flavored drink. My stomach and throat does feel good after having some. I also ordered the similar product by Lily of the Desert which is 10$ cheaper. I wanted to like it since it was priced lower, but the taste is much worse. I'll probably stick to this brand. This one is priced a bit high, though, wish it was under 20$.",
            "My family loves this mix!  It gives them the health benefits of whole grain in their pancakes and waffles in a moist non-grainy tasteful way.

            "I bought a 12 pack of the smaller cans for about five dollars less than this before I had seen that they offer the peas in the bigger cans. You get double the amount for only a little bit more. The peas are the same quality in either can and are a much better deal when you buy the larger cans. As far as I know they only offer whole kernel corn and sweet peas in this large size. Will buy again and again as long as the price doesn't increase :)",
            "My 5 year old just prepared a cup of this for me and it tastes just like the dairy version, or at least the way I remember regular hot cocoa tasting. I wish Amazon sold this directly because I would most definatly buy a whole case for the entire family to drink. Having a dairy allergy there are alot of things a person misses out on. I no longer have to drool over the hot cocoa my husband and kids drink on those cozy winter nights.",

            "While paying nearly $7 for a candy bar may seem overly indulgent, you'll get over it the moment you take your first bite! I used to treat myself with a  Kirsch  candy bar occasionally when I was stationed in Germany, 30 years ago.  I'm thrilled to see they are still around. Ah, I clearly recall savoring one of them on my way home from work on the  S-Bahn .  Sitting there in total luxury on the train after a long day at the hospital, I'd open the paper wrapper, and sloooowly pull back the foil to expose the first row of sections. Mmmm-gotta say, the flavor of the chocolate along with the cherry liquor made my day. And, during the winter time, I coincidentally found that by the time I'd finished the bar and got off the train, there was nothin' nippin' at my nose OR my toes on the walk home!  It didn't even concern me on one occasion when I got home to find my husband attempting to flush an entire German cheesecake down the toilet, rather than take it out to the trash. I simply pulled up the bathroom carpet and watched the fun.  It ends the way you think it would.  But I was in my Happy Place.",

            "I love Indian snacks and this mix is very good indeed.  A nice mixture of tastes and textures.  Makes a great and generally healthy snack but is also good as a spicy crunchy topping on dal or steamed vegetables.  I give this mixture 5 stars but some of my American friends have complained that it is too spicy for their taste.",

            "You don't have to be Greek to enjoy this fabulous white. I often find it hard to interpret professional wine reviews so I will provide the simplest evaluation possible. Imagine an excellent Savignon Blanc with a mild citrus taste but slightly sweeter. That is what you experience with the 2011 Santorini Sigalas Assyrtiko. It is an excellent white wine to serve at a gathering,  with or without hors d'oeuvres.<br /><br />If you have never had an assyrtiko or moschofilero, they tend to be slightly sweeter than most mainstream whites from California or Australia but are a long way from dessert wines.  To the American pallet, Moscholifero tends to have overall stronger taste than assyrtiko. Of all of the Greek white wines I have tasted, this is the best. Friends agree.  It is also a solid value at the 20 dollar price point. Incidentally, this wine is one of the highest rated ever by major reviewers -- 93 points by the Wine Advocate.<br /><br />Greek wines often haven't been well received in the US by non-Greeks.  From what I have experienced, there are a handful of truly awful Greek wines that simply taste nothing like mainstream white wines.  These extremes have tainted reviewers and dissuaded consumers from exploring Greek wines. This wine is a example of something mainstream consumers and connoisseurs alike can enjoy - either with dinner or while entertaining.",
            "My first impression of this roast was that it was bitter.  But the aftertaste was so compelling, it drew me to drink more.  And more.  And after about half a cup, I realized that the bitterness that I was tasting was nothing more than the flavor of fresh hazelnuts.<br /><br />I received a free sample of this by ordering through a third party website, and my reaction is that it is just so fresh.  I'm ordinarily not a fan of vanilla or hazelnut, so I made sure that this was one of the first I tried to get it out of the way.  But there is a high likelihood that I might order more.  I norally don't like my coffee bitter, but this bitterness was absolutely delicious.  And as I noted, the aftertaste left my mouth feeling almost refreshed.  And speaking of refreshed, I just can't get over how fresh this tasted.  I didn't think that flavor from a pod could be this good.<br /><br />After drinking a pod of a different flavor, I found that the bitterness wasn't from the hazelnut.  It is the coffee itself.  So while the aroma and aftertaste are quite good, I had to dock a star for the bitterness.",

            "[Edit to add: A friend stayed at my house for a week recently and said  This is the most delicious tea I've ever had in my life.   She's a huge tea fan, so that is definitely saying something.  So, I've upped my star rating to a 4 (that's the average of my opinion (3) and her opinion (5)).  In light of her reaction, this tea may well be worth a try.]<br /><br />Original review:<br />I live in Japan where we drink oolong tea daily.  I usually buy my flavored teas in the US, because here in Japan they emphasize the aroma of the tea as it is brews rather than the taste, whereas in the US they emphasize the quality of the taste over the quality of the aroma.  This offers nothing outstanding in either area.  The aroma is present but nothing fantastic, and I can't taste the apricot in this at all.<br /><br />This is an upper medium-grade oolong tea, not the delicate high-grade Chinese oolong I was expecting at this price.  This is important because oolong tea is stunning when high-grade, perfectly nasty when low-grade, and merely OK when medium-grade.  It's upper medium-grade, so still very good, but not the stunning flavor I was expecting at this price.  (On reflection, perhaps the high price comes from the fact that it is organic, rather than from using only the highest-grade tea leaves.)<br /><br />Visually all the teas from this series are very appealing and they are ready to give  as is  if you need a housewarming gift, gift for your child's teacher, etc.  The package closes securely so you don't need to worry about the tea leaves not keeping well.",
            "Torani, the flavored syrup often presumed to originate from Italy, but actually manufactured in South San Francisco ( The industrial City --their motto, not mine) makes many delicious flavors, and hazelnut is one of my favorites.<br /><br />The hazelnut refers to any nuts from the species of the genus Corylus. While raw hazelnuts can have a bitter taste, their culinary uses are many, extending from common pralines and other candies (including  NUtella ) to the rarified confections of Europe, such as the justly famous Viennese hazelnut torte. Hazelnut is no stranger to the coffee house scene,  and when mixed with vodka, hazelnut liqueurs (Frangelica, most famoulsy) enjoy widespread popularity , both straight and as a topping.  Even hazelnut butter is making a stand in the United States and Europe.<br /><br />ALl this is to say that adding hazelnut syrup to your coffee (especially) or perhaps to ice cream, can be vigorously defended against specious attack by foodies: It enjoys a widespread and international esteem.  Torani'z hazelnut is a non-alcoholic sweetner whicih imparts discernable hazelnut flavor, and it can add a great deal of depth of flair to an otherwise ordinary coffee drink.  It's not as sweet or one-dimensional as the Vanilla flavor, although a higher ratio of hazelnut to sugar would certainly improve the experience. It's relatively inexpensive, so that you can find your favorite flavors for various concoctions. A nice bright bottle, too, often left out for display purposes in the unpretensious bohemian caf&eacute;. There will be those black coffee drinkers, gloating over rejected poetry and stinking Galois, who will scorn the use of such a sweetener; it is perhaps best to leave then alone.",

This is really a  must try  product.<br /><br />By the way, my package arrived in 2 days even though it wasn't supposed to ship for a week. Also, those 6 bottles came in the best designed packing material I've ever received in an Amazon order - no peanuts and rolled newspaper here! This shipment will be gone in the blink of an eye so I plan to order more soon.",
            "I am trying to train my dog and he is not particularly food greedy. However, he LOVES cheese! But as you may know, cheese isn't that portable. So I needed a cheese treat that was pretty much 100% cheese with nothing else added. This is it! My dog is crazy about these because they are just cheese. I am using them as his training reward (along with freeze-dried chicken) and he is responding because these aren't your every day dog bone. I also feel better giving these to my dog as frequently as necessary in training because he is not getting alot of additional ingredients such as grains. I highly recommend these treats. The company also ships very rapidly!",

It's about the same liquid to fish ratio as standard tuna, except instead of water you pour down the sink, you get very well seasoned sauces. The  Sweet Chili  flavor features a very nice chili taste with a sweet finish and very little heat. 170-calories (give or take)per can. Throw in some mini carrote and a few crackers, and you have a very satisfying meal for very few calories. The price is great too!",

            "I use Purina Cat Chow 3.5 pound bag of dry food as the base for my blend of four different foods for my two cats. I purchase these four bags, sit down with two large plastic containers and mix the four together. I keep them stirred so the four are well-blended. My two females love the taste of each of the four and they are getting the benefits of all four varieties (at least that is what my mind thinks).

The other one who does not have food issues lies patiently yet thinks she is getting such a treat when I put out a few pieces for her. She likes the Dental flavor the best.<br /><br />When I finish and put out a fresh bowl of food and water,  you talk about happy! The first one, Mizu, has snacked so much she eats just a few bites, then she's gone. Next Molly stretches and walks nonchalantly to the bowl and has her few bites.

The perfectly sliced lean strips with their heavenly taste and aroma was always a winner on the breakfast table or as an ingredient in my other dishes. The last two orders I placed with Nueske's have been a huge dissapointment. Much of the smokey flavor was missing and the amount grease left over after frying was astounding; leaving me with hardly any meat. The company is now obviously purchasing inferior pork bellies and rushing the processing time. There are many other premium bacons on the market that are worth a premium price. I would suggest to my fellow bacon connaisseurs out there that you give one of these other companies a try and forget about Greaseke's",
            "This Habanero sauce is potent! Only a few drops are needed to add a lot of heat to any dish. The Habanero pepper is very hot so it is hardly a surprise this sauce is quite potent (the habanero chile is likely the hottest pepper you'll ever find in any grocery store).<br /><br />This sauce is OK - It is similar to Tabasco in terms of its potency but I prefer it far more because it has no vinegar and tomatoes have been added to the mix.<br /><br />This sauce is potent, adds a great deal of heat to any dish with just a few drops. It has a very subtle sweet tomato flavor to it and has no vinegar notes. Considerable heat along with a vague hint of some tomato sweetness are its major flavor notes. The tomato taste and its sweetness however are quite subtle.<br /><br />I think this is a good hot sauce but certainly not a great one.  A true 2 or 3 star product. Primarily it delivers heat - and just that!!! Yet it has no real flaws either.<br /><br />Watch out for sellers who offer a low product price combined with high shipping charges.",

Is it really crunchy? Yes. To hard to chew, No. (Well not for me. I always let me granola soak in my nut milk for a few minutes anyways.  I found the agave/chocolate ratio was just right as this granola is not to sweet or chocolaty, it is just about right.<br /><br />I usually have two ounces at a serving which gives me eight servings for the entire bag which comes to about $1.25 per serving for the two-package 16 oz bag combo.

She suggested that he should stay away from grains because they are a pro-inflammatory and could make his knees hurt more.<br />It's difficult to find the smaller cans for my little Chi in town, so I've had to order them.

Even if we poor Celiac patients have to make do with much dry backed goods, and I mean some of it is dust-storm-dry, even so, I just can not justify to pay more for the shipping then for the cookies themselves. So make sure you always check the shipping charges before ordering anything, especially since cookies are not a food group, unfortunately. I have been in internet shopping and selling from its start and I know many sellers do try and make some extra income charging unreasonable rates for shipping by calling it HANDLING charges. This cookie bag weighs only 3.7 oz and I don't care how good you pack it this does not cost $5.05 for shipping. Did you know that a 1 oz letter costs $.44?<br />I am sorry if I sound angry, but as a Celiac I am very much upset for being taken advantage of because I have a disease which makes me have to shop for special foods. And this is exactly what is going on here. By the time you have ordered from 4 to 6 sellers you end up paying enough for shipping that you could live off another month, and that is robbery. So I decided enough is enough and I am making sure you know about it before you go through quick check out(worst way to go!) or having to go back after having spent so much time online comparing prices just to find at checkout that you can't afford it because of such excess shipping charges.",

            "My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more  crumbly , i.e. there is a lot more  food dust  in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called  Simply Nourish , and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing  Innova Cat & Kitten , or planning to buy it in the future, we believe that P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!",

I thought I might prefer the hazelnut version since I'm not a chocolate lover, but in this case, the chocolate version is better because it offers a better balance of flavors.  The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate in this case!",

I had to have something, so I bought Konriko's. And I've never gone back.  I now have to order it online at unheard of prices because the grocery store no longer carries it, but I do so because it really is the best. It's the perfect blend of salt, spiciness, and FLAVOR.

I've tried Bigelow, Harrods, etc. and I like Twinings best, either loose or in bags, so I know exactly what this tea is supposed to taste like.  I was a bit concerned that the K-cups would disappoint, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I tried the 3 smallest brew sizes before I found a trick that works for me.  I double-brew one K-cup on the smallest setting.  By this I mean that I run the water through 1 K-cup twice, both times on the smallest size which makes a large cup that for me is about the right strength and flavor.  When you factor in the convenience and speed of using the Keurig, this makes getting a good cup of tea a breeze.",
            "I originally bought this tea from a well known retailer and loved it, but they are very expensive. This is a great price. I make the tea by the gallon and serve it iced. It tastes as good as fruit juice when I sweeten it with a little stevia, but is a much more healthy alternative to fruit juices which naturally contain lots of sugar. My husband even loves it and he is not much of a tea drinker like me, and recently my 3 year old started drinking it instead of juice. This tea is a staple in our house. I have purchased from culinary teas twice now and been very satisfied both times.",
            "A nutritionist recommended Kashi products and bars to me.  When you want a little bit of chocolate, these don't quite replace a Snickers Candy Bar or Chocolate Chip Cookie, but they come close enough for me.  They're a non-guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is good for you, say health experts.  These also pack 5g protein and 4g(15%) of fiber.  Only 8g of sugar (a Snickers candy bar has 28.8 g of sugar by comparison or almost 4X the sugar of these Kashi bars--nutritionists say your body burns sugar BEFORE fat as it's easier to burn so your body will keep the fat.) These are only 120 calories per bar vs. 280 calories in a Snickers bar--not to pick on Snickers but it demonstrates why these are healthier than most candy bars.  I like to take them in the car when I'm running errands and need something to tide me over, or they're a tasty after-meal treat.<br /><br />A confession: I grabbed this box by accident at the grocery store thinking I was buying this Kashi bar: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B002DHNIBG >Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bar, Dark Mocha Almond, 6-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> which is my absolute favorite.  I generally like my chocolate straight-up and not mixed with fruit.  However, as an alternative, the cherry taste is refreshing although I think the dark chocolate taste, which I love, is stronger in the other bar with the almonds.  Family members may prefer this one, however.  So, it's great to have two healthy treats in the house that are better nutrition than a candy bar or cookie.<br /><br />If you like the taste of cherry with chocolate, you may want to try these bars.",

            "Epoisses is not well known.  For those of you who know what washed rind cheese is, this is one of the greats.  For those of you who do not, this is a class of cheese that is strong.  So do not serve it as the only choice for the uninitiated.  Better to serve at least the classic three choices, one sheep, one goat and this for the cow.  You know, half a Noah.<br /><br />If you are trying it for yourself for the first time, here are a couple of points:<br /><br />- take most of the top crust off, gently with a sharp paring knife and fork.  Not deep.  The crust is soft.<br /><br />- let the cheese come to room temperature (this is a creamy almost soupy cheese and looses most of its taste if cold and firm)<br /><br />- serve with a small spoon, no bigger than an espresso spoon.  (caviar spoons work.  in a pinch, the handle of an ice cream bar works.  The point is not to have big glops extracted)<br /><br /> - good on bread.  Bath Oliver crackers are good.  Water crackers or cream crackers.<br /><br />Wine is essential.  The first time I had this cheese, I had a shmear on a piece of bread.  Wow, the cheese was extraordinary.  Then I had a mouth wash of white wine.  Then the cheese opened into the transformational moment of perfection.  True Sartori.  So always serve with cool white wine,  The fat and alcohol mate to explode all the hidden flavors.<br /><br />My choice is a Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru.  But since I cannot pay for my choice, I am reduced to mere extacy  with a good chalky, flinty Frascati.  For American wines, the new style of lean, un-oaked chardonnay works.  You might better reach for a Fume Blanc otherwise.<br /><br />If you are interested but not quite comfortable, then go for the plain Epoisses, not the creamy.  It is a gateway cheese, as we pushers say.<br /><br />Finally, this is a fair price to pay.",

            "This set arrived quickly and is nicely packaged for gift giving.  It includes a good sample selection of sea salts and has been fun to try.  Great for those starting out to explore the world of sea and finishing salts.  The company has many more interesting salts where these came from.",
            "I was pretty pleased when I tried this item after a recent food service show. There is a very strong chocolate smell and taste. One bar has 150 calories (30 from fat) and 9 grams of sugar (versus 16 in the old Cocoa puffs cereal and milk bars). The texture is different, it looks more like cocoa krispies than puffs and my jaw hurt from chewing so much but overall it is a nice option for people (especially kids) who don't have time to have a sit-down breakfast in the morning.",
            "I make all the birthday cakes for our grandchildren and I love decorating cupcakes and cookies as well. When I want my cake frosting to be pure white, this is the gel I use. It's awesome! I found out about this product from my stepson who is in culinary school. I'm so happy he had given me a few samples of it.",
            "I recieved the delivery quicker than I thought I would. I was concerned with how the food item would be packaged. The Gyro slices were still frozen when I recieved them. The gyro slices were delicious, they taste better than most of the restaurants I frequent.",
            "5 yo Tibetan terrier, 4 yo black lab mix and 1 yo rottweiler/ German Shepard mix all love these.  Bag was really cheap for 6 lbs. Didn't look at ingredients list, probably not good if so cheap, but dogs seemed to love it.",

            "I was surprisingly happy with these crackers. I got them to put in our  hangover kits  that we made for our guests as a favor for our wedding. They came in quickly and taste like any other saltine cracker. I agree that the packaging wasn't that great, but unlike the other review, there were VERY few crumbled up crackers... Maybe my UPS man just handled the package better? The only complaint I have is that there was no expiration date. I know they last long, but who knows when they were made. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. It's great for what I'm using it for and it was a great price.",
            "I have always enjoyed Earl Grey tea because of the flavor of Bergamot.  I was pleased to find that there is this version of Earl Grey with Double Bergamot which only enhances the flavor!  I love this tea and believe anyone who enjoys Earl Grey will love this as well.",
            "The raspberry newtons have been my favorite for several years, but during the last year none of the local stores have stocked them (only the strawberry newtons).  Glad I found them on Amazon.  And the price including shipping is a little less than the grocery store price.  So count me happy!!",
            "I've been sucking on these and some other sugar alcohol hard candies for a couple of months, trying to stave off the munchies, and they're generally really good. Though some other Werther's flavors are mostly sweet with little punch, the Caramel Coffee have lots of flavor.<br /><br />The package says that a serving is 5 pieces, but that seems a lot. Each individual piece has 3 g of carbohydrates, with 2.8 g from Sugar Alcohol. Some say that is a net of 1.6 g each. I have diabetes and I've checked my blood glucose level at 15 minutes and an hour after eating a couple, and I see no spike at all. Perhaps different people metabolize these things differently, so individual mileage may vary. The best thing would be to check the blood and see if these work for you. They do for me.",
            "After trying both SK Orange Mango and 5-hour Energy Berry, I must say that SK is soo much better in both taste and the desired result- energy.  I could not stand the smell and taste of the 5-hour Energy drink I tried.  I didn't even want to finish it.  The Street King Orange Mango drink tasted great and it gave me energy all day- even though I only took half of it.  I love that one bottle can give me energy for two whole 8-hour work days.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to other energy drinks.  And, I think it is pretty cool of 50 Cent to donate a meal for a child in need through the United Nations World Food Programme for every shot purchased.  So in effect, this energy drink gives you the energy to get through the day and the proceeds go to a good cause.  Can't beat that! :)",
            "Love this tea, and it smells divine!  It definitely put me in the Christmas spirit.  I drink it plain, but I can imagine it could be doctored to resemble Starbuck's Chai Tea with a some sweetener and cream.",
            "Absolutely delish.  If you love regular Branston then you will certainly enjoy their beetroot pickle.  It essentially adds a bit of a change to your cheese and pickle ploughman's or to a cheese pie or tart; cheese on toast; the works.  Is equally tasty in a ham, cheese or bacon sarnie(sandwich).",
            "These i think are the most awesome gummies, and i love the videogame theme. There is no weird after taste, and they are like eating gummybears just shaped different. If you get these with the gameboy advance game cases(shaped like the system) for the cases, you will be disapointed however. Not in the flavor of course, but the cases do not hold the games securely and they flop around in the case. So i'd recommend just buying the boxes, you get more anyways.",
            "I use a lot of olive oil and bought this to refill a previous smaller bottle of Baja. It has a pretty distinctive olive taste, which I like for salad dressings. Not too acidic.  It seems to have a high smoke point for use in frying. Good value for money. As usual for large bottles of oil: keep cool or in refrigerator and squeeze in a few capsules of Vitamin E to slow down oxidation and keep fresh.",
            "This soup is delicious!  Unfortunately it makes a bit much for one person, but it is a good leftover.  Very tasty.",
            "Well I have to admit I'm surprised.  I grew up with Lawry's Salt addicts, and I find that way too harsh.  I've tried different types of flavored salts but they always seemed to be too strong, imbalanced toward one particular flavor, chemically, or otherwise just plain weird.<br /><br />Because of that, I didn't have high expectations for this product, but the reviews were persuasive, and I did want to have a product of this type for convenience.<br /><br />Upon receiving and trying it, after the first use I realized this would be a staple in my pantry.  What a great seasoning product!  It's hard to define it because this product is nicely balanced and I would say subtle while still being quite effective even in a small amount.<br /><br />I want to point out also that this isn't overly salty, which is GREAT.  I don't use salt much on my food - mainly only on certain items.  Because of that, I tend to favor specialty gourmet salts (since I don't burn through them so fast as to make the expensive price an issue).  Specialty salts tend to have a lot of punch but remain discrete.  In other words, they don't turn the entire dish salty so much as distribute some salt here and there.  This variation keeps the palate invigorated with less actual salt used.  Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt seems to work in the same way.  You don't need much, and while it adds some salt flavor, it's not overkill.  Likewise, the other ingredients in the mix are very nicely balanced such that you have a great blend that seems to enhance the food it's added to rather than dominating it.<br /><br />I wish I would have tried this product sooner.  I am looking forward to trying it on different things; next will probably be deviled eggs!",
            "I ordered three of the trays (being a date nut) and found that two were old or stale. I admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package, but still - dried out fruit.?! The last tray was fresher, but the experience was soured at that point. I'm disappointed.",
            "We've originally bought this as our dog's first food and then switched to Wellness. Dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to Newman's own and now our dog feels a lot better. Never switched his food ever again.",
            "Great tasting tea. Really good quality. Great price per ounce (about half the price that I could find anywhere else). Can be rebrewed up to three times per directions (so it lasts a while). The only downside is you have to buy 1 pound of tea, that's a whole lot. If you can afford it, or split it with someone then this is a great deal.",
            "I say that perhaps this isn't a valid review because in all honesty, I didn't eat any of it.  I bought this product because I had read about some health benefits of Hing.  However, when it arrived, I found the smell of it so offensive that I couldn't bring myself to add it to any foods.  So I ended up tossing it away. I gave it 3 stars because I honestly don't know if it is excellent Hing or a not so good Hing. Sorry.",
            "I had these back in Sweden since i was a kid and they have always been in my candy bag as standard.<br /><br />It has that perfect gummy texture that no other candy have. I wish US could import more swedish/german candy, because the american taste of candy is kind of horrible.",

            "EXCELLENT!! my husband likes lemon desserts.  I did not know if he would like this but he thought it was great. Even with the glaze.  It has such a freshly squeezed lemon juice flavor and the glaze only adds to the freshness.  If a light, refreshing cake is what you are looking for, this is it.so happy to find it and since it is made by Carnation, I felt it would be good.",
            "Recently found recipe(blueberry scone recipe from America's Test Kitchen) that tastes very much like the mini chocolate chips scones from wildflower bread company in Sedona, AZ.  So had to get GOOD mini chocolate chips and these fit the bill.",
            "I was feeding a very high quality food, but something in it was bothering my 2 oldest Cavaliers.  They were getting grumbly stomachs too often for my liking (about twice a week or so).  So I started looking for another food with a smaller ingredient panel and lower fat, higher fiber.  I also use canned and dry.  I remembered that I had used Mulligan Stew cans in the past and the dogs loved it and did very well on it, so I started researching the food and company to see if I felt they met my standards as a trustworthy company.  I love the science behind the food.  They don't use any synthetic vitamins/minerals and after finding out that they use no Asian sourced ingredients, the kibble is baked so it's more digestible, the ingredient panel for both kibble and canned is smaller, and the company representative Diane was a dream to work with and very knowledgable I decided to order a 5lb. bag to try (I used an amazon gift card I had).  When the bag came, I transitioned them immediately (using probiotics and enzymes to help).  It went great!  I still used the Fromm Gold canned food (until I could order in some Mulligan Stew cans) and the Mulligan Stew dry.  They ate it like candy!  I couldn't wait to see if the grumbly stomachs continued and if their stool looked okay.  Well, after about 4 days they've not had a stomach episode at all, their stool is normal, they eat it up like it's candy and my oldest Cavalier is actually acting a little more lively.  I'm sure her stomach was hurting before.  Needless to say, I'm ordering a larger order of the kibble and some cases of the canned.  Mulligan Stew seems to be the ticket for my dogs' good health.  Thanks!",

You can get this tea at many grocery stores, and there are many places online were you can get free shipping.",

The entire loaf was gone in about 5 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!  We added the 8 oz. of water and then added another ounce because the dough looked a little dry.  Again, this was one of the best breads we have made here yet and will be ordering some very soon!!",

I tried a jar of Red Star yeast and what a differrence!  I now get a beautiful rise and flavor that reminds me of fresh baked breads and rolls from the bakery.  If you want the perfect loaf I suggest you use Red Star regular or their bread machine yeast, both are made by the SAF company, the other perfect yeast and all are available through Amazon at a great price!",
            "While rather expensive, it is very tasty and a real treat for those wanting the authentic ramune experience.  It tastes like a more carbonated, slightly less syrupy-sweet version of 7-Up.<br /><br />I highly recommend it and plan to purchase more.",

            "The Hormel Compleats that contain sauce always contain a lot more of it than the picture on the packaging suggests.  This variety is no exception.  The picture is very misleading and suggests a much more solid meal than you get.<br /><br />The ravioli are thin and underfilled.  The marinara sauce has an unusually strong flavor, one which may or may not be to your personal liking.  I disliked it mostly because I found it distinctly sweet (the ingredients include sugar and high fructose corn syrup).  As it also contains vinegar, the taste is reminiscent of a Chinese sweet and sour sauce.<br /><br />If you are looking for a convenient, very light snack with a strong and unusual taste, you might give this a try, but I would want less sugar in the sauce and more filling in the ravioli before I tried it again.",

            "This is a flavorful pouch of baby food. It tastes better than Sprout's pasta with lentil bolognese, that had no flavor. If you eat bland and boring food at home then your baby probably won't like this pouch of red lentils.  We eat all types of foods in my house ( ethnic  as the other reviewer describes, and American) so this was naturally a hit for my babies. I would go so far as to say that the red lentils taste authentic, just without the hot spice factor.  I also like that it is a large portion of food (5.5 ounces).",

One they hated and wouldn't eat, one was ok, but I settled on Science Diet because of it's good reputation.  Almost immediately, I started finding spit-ups of largely undigested food everywhere.  Realized that we had the same problem with our prior cats on Science Diet.  It may be more costly, especially with shipping, but I am going back.  The savings in time and clean-up efforts are worth it, my kitties love it, and it smells so good I almost want to eat it!",

We tried Zoka's Colonel Fitzroy a couple month's ago and immediatley decided it was our new favorite.  It's similar to a Sumatra, but has a hint of chocolate unertones.  I love it because I can drink it black.  It has no bitter aftertaste.  Drinking coffee black allows the rich sweetness to resonate and means no calories.  Making it a keeper for sure!",

Definitely will order this item from them again.<br />==================================<br /><br />I left above comments right after I received the case of apple juice(12 big bottles). But after we went through couple of the bottles, we found out there was a FLY inside of the just opened apple juice bottle. That is very gross,nasty and yuk!!!<br /><br />Without second thoughts we discarded the whole bottle juice and contacted the company right away by email. After exchange couple emails and because we didn't take any picture of the fly was swimming in the apple juice pool, the company said he can't replace or refund us anything. I completely understand that, this is an evidence world and honestly speaking, a bottle of apple juice doesn't cost that much of money (maybe $5?).<br /><br />But the main problem is, if there is a fly inside of the bottle, is that mean the whole container be polluted during processing by the fly in the factory? I hope not!!!<br /><br />It's not about the money issue or we try to steal few dollars from this company, it's about quality control and do you care about how does your customer feel? For people will buy cases organic apple juice that means they really focus on food safety and quality. It beyond just dollars!!!!",

I had thought I was ordering the Rice Thins, but, when they arrived, they were not what I had originally thought I was ordering.  When you order, it got a bit confusing because I did not know Sesmark had so many varieties of Sesame thins.  I should have specified Rice thins.  I had not.  When I received my order, the ones I received were the Sesame thins Original with Flaxseed.  They were more cracker like and dryer than the rice thins.  When ordering, make sure you are ordering carefully. If it is the rice thins you want, with the description, check to see it says rice thins.  Also, I don't know why it is that so many of the crackers were cracked during transportation.  They were Shipped in the original carton the crackers were packed in and then another box.  Somehow, these do not arrive well and need a new way of being packaged so they arrive in better condition. These small crackers are flavorful and I would recommend them.",

The only thing I was not expecting is the packaging is different than the photo provided, and the cooking time they suggest needs to be increased (I.M.O.).  But I expect lots of high quality pastas always need tinkering depending on what your making. My only regret is that I didn't buy more at the time because it was so good we went through all 3 bags in 2 weeks! My Shrimp Cavatelli in sage cream sauce is that good apparently! :) If you'd like the recipe let me know. ;)",

I usually like my tea pretty sweet, adding honey and sugar, but with this one, I just only added about a teaspoon of sugar to a 12 oz. cup and it was delicious.  It's not overly sweet though, and just a touch of cherry and marzipan.  I love it, and I will definitely be buying this one.",

You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect.<br /><br />Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia.

            "My baby skipped the purees and would not touch rice cereal. These puffs were one of her first solid foods when she was about 7 months. They are puffed up air things which easily dissolve in the mounth so there is no choking hazard. Most of what is in the container and puffs is air, so don't expect a lot of nutrition out of it. The container has 6 half cup servings of 25 calories. My little one got far more servings out of it. It is just to get them used to solid stuff, not to fill them up. Unlike the rice cereal, my little one liked these rice based puffs. The vanilla puffs have cute little star shapes. Not looking at the label of the container, my husband popped open the lid and ate half the container. He freaked out once I told him he ate baby food but said it tasted pretty good. I tried a few and I must say they are fairly sweet and not bad tasting at all. They are much sweeter than the HAPPYBABY brand puffs and that sweeter taste is preferred by my sweeth-tooth baby and hubby. The disadvantage of these puffs is that they tend to stick. Babies put their fingers in their mouth and end up with drooly fingers. When the little one was picking up the little puffs with her wet fingers, these puffs started sticking to her fingers which was somewhat frustrating for her (the reason I docked one star).",

This has got to be the cheapest 12-month club of any product that I've found (heck, even a hot sauce club is over $200, and this is way cooler than hot sauce).  This is a great personal gift that allows the person to be creative in their uses.  The terrine was lovely, albeit smaller than I had expected.  It was a well received gift that would be great for anyone who enjoys cooking and likes to try different things.  The seller was even accommodating to ship me the terrine to give as the gift and send the remaining months of spices to the gifted.  Got to love customer service!",
            "I really enjoy this tea, after I had figured out not to use boiling water when making it. Apparently, white and green tea become bitter if the water is too hot and it is steeped too long. So, my recommendation is to let the water cool a little and steep the tea for about one minute or less. I says 3 minutes on the box, but to my taste that is too long. Quite a subtle peach flavor, not artificial tasting. White tea has more antioxidants and less caffeine than green or black tea. So happy to have found a tasty beverage that is good for my health and the health of the planet!",
            "I decided to try these Cedrinca candies mainly because they are eligible for free shipping (many of the  gourmet  products are not).  They are REALLY GREAT, and have the most intense honey flavor of any filled or unfilled honey candies that I have tasted.  The filling consists of quite a dollop of honey, so the candies are fairly large, and for a hard candy addict like myself, it's not practical to suck on them when I'm trying to carry on a conversation, or just have a hard candy discreetly in public.  For those situations I would recommend the Go Naturally honey candies, which are much smaller, and also eligible for free shipping.  In fact, the Cedrinca honey candies are so addictive that I keep them in an inconvenient drawer, so that I have time to think  do I really need another one?  before getting them out. On the downside, in addition to sugar and honey, the Cedrinca candies do contain  glucose syrup,  which according to Wikipedia is the same as corn syrup (I don't know if it's high-fructose corn syrup or not).  The Go Naturally products contain just  Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, & Organic Honey  - so they might be more suitable for people who are trying to avoid corn syrup.",

The  Cocoa Rouge  on the label is no lie, it is an unusual red color, closer to natural cocoa than the dark brown you get with a heavily processed cocoa.

I couldn't imagine them topping the original, but they did with these crackers.<br /><br />My favorite type of cheese is cheddar, so it actually makes sense that I would love these.  They have a very strong, sharp cheddar flavor.  It doesn't taste artificial at all, but tastes like the cheddar I buy for my sandwiches.  I can sit down and eat a box all by myself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they have lots of calories.  25 crackers contain 150 calories, almost half of which are from fat.  So, while I can eat an entire box, I try to pace myself.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy Cheez-Its.  But if I have a choice, I go for these any day of the week.",

Yet, none of the flavors is overwhelming.  The problem with Orange Milano cookies is that it is hard to stop after eating only one.<br /><br />These cookies are relatively expensive compared to other brands.  However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.

            "**UPDATE**<br />There is legal info on their website about the lawsuit.  From their side the calories were pretty close to their claim and the fat content was almost right on, but they didn't use the legal serving size.  They've corrected the label and have to do periodic testing as part of the settlement.  The correction isn't that far from what they originally claimed, but some users of the dressings claim the taste is different, worse, and they must have changed their recipe to make the calories/fat match the labels.  My own experience is that this is still a low-cal dressing and I still really like the taste.  I couldn't really tell a taste difference unless I had an old bottle to compare side-by-side, assuming it is actually different.  The plus for us is that we now know the label is correct, maybe even more reliably so than most other dressings.  So try it and like it, or don't.  I do still suggest not buying by the case, it just doesn't last long enough.  Also watch expiration dates in store carefully, lots of stores not good about rotating and this still isn't a big seller so it's more likely to sit longer.  I'm buying it though.  Bottom line is still taste and calories, which is great on both counts.",

The shipping service that I provide is 5-8 business days  and that they  do not guarantee that USPS will deliver it by this weekend .  TWO WEEKS delivery time to travel ONE hour away????  I went back to this item page and BURIED far down is a link that gets you to their shipping rates.....saying it could take up to TWENTY ONE DAYS for an item to be delivered.

VERY interesting how they don't feel the need to put all this shipping information up front in the DESCRIPTION section, and they can basically send you ANY ingredients they want, saying it is a substitution?  Also check their web page and it states they ship in 2 days after you place order and it takes 4 to 14 days or as long as 21 days...so which is it?  NEXT they state:  We will send your order within 2-3 business days using USPS priority mail flat rate service.

NO wrapping or padding whatsoever, just the plastic bag of FIVE pounds of candy stuffed into a too-small envelope!  This product SHOULD have at LEAST been shipped in a small cardboard box with bubble wrap or SOME insulated padding.  Upon opening the envelope the gummy frogs were all stuck together, and tasted quite rubbery (and I LIKE, and am familiar with, textures of other gummy candy)... but this was like trying to eat rubber!) The taste was faint and not very apple-like. In fact it was quite awful.<br /><br />VERY BAD TRANSACTION AND AWFUL WRAPPING/PACKING/SHIPPING AND HORRIBLE PRODUCT!",
            "These are AMAZING! I worked retail and we used to sell these in the store I worked in. I bought every flavor of Byrd's cupcake cookies throughout the course of time, and the Black and White ones are the best by far, even though the others are VERY good as well! Also try Byrd's Key Lime Coolers. Being from the South, and only a few hours from Savannah where they're made I love supporting a local company. These are great for gifts and I have given them as Christmas gifts every year! Byrd cookies tend to be expensive, yes, but they are worth it and make great gifts.",
            "i purchased the giant gummy bear on a stick for the Girlfriend, on valentines day.  Apperance wise she loved it, but as soon as she was done eating the bears ears, she stopped. Being sweet and polite she told me she was full, but i bought this knowing she loves gummy bears and i finally got it out of her, that it had a bad aftertaste.  Thank god i didnt buy the 5lb one, otherwise i would be writing letters to president giant gummy bear.  All and all i don't regret buying it, because just the look on the loved ones face when they first see the giant blob of high fructose corn syrup and sugar is worth it!",

            "This Jack Link's Premium Cuts Peppered Beef Jerky is one of the better Jack Link's jerkies in terms of both texture and taste. It is tender and easy to chew, neither too chewy nor stringy. Some jerkies are really hard to bite into and tear a piece off with your teeth, but this isn't one of them. At the same time it isn't too tender that it's gross to chew on, but it's really got a pretty good, solid consistency while being moderately thin (around a quarter-centimeter width). It has a bold taste that is not excessively spicy but definitely has some kick to it, and tastes great compared to other Jack Link's jerkies (cough cough Matador cough). There isn't a whole lot in a single package, but if you shop in the right place you can get it for pretty cheap ($3.99 at Target as of writing). Not the best jerky I've ever had, but definitely worth trying if you like jerky.",
            "For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Buffalo Style Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I consider to be a disappointment.  I have tried this product several times, but my opinion of it has not changed.  Even though it is not bad, it is not good, either--it has a dull flavor.  When it comes to the heat level, neither is it too hot nor too mild.  I am glad that I gave this product a shot, but I just am not pleased with it.  Actually, I rate this hot sauce 2.5 stars.",

I have no affiliation with the company and just wanted to put my 2 cents in here.  I really do like the cinnamon a lot!",

My only gripe would be that there is no grinder built-in (which would be convenient), but I simply transferred these white peppercorns to an old grinder that I had and it worked just fine.<br /><br />For those curious as to the flavor of white pepper vs black - I must say that they are very similar. The white is perhaps a little more 'tame', but really the difference is just the color.",

Will this product be the end all fix for tricking your kids to get the proper amount of veggies a day. No way, but that doesn't make it a bad product, just not a miracle in a pouch. Each pouch is one combined serving of fruit and vegetable. That doesn't mean one serving of veggies and than one fruit but only one serving made up of both. The taste isn't bad at all. My kids inhale them as soon as I ration out their daily allowance. I noticed the amount of sugar in these and only allow one a day. My kids would love to drink these all day long if allowed. They pass the kid taste test approval. I subtracted the 5th star and only give a 4 because of the amount of sugar to volume, and that the juice is not 100% juice. I would love to see a Super-V drink with 100% juice and not the 66% it currently has. The Berry is the best tasting one in my opinion, but since we also buy apple, and fruit punch Super-V I notice they all go just as fast when offered to the kids.",

Plus, each stick is only 15 calories, so you can watch your proportion if that matters to you. I will definitely purchase this again.",

It's the only reasonably priced cat food with quality ingredients and no corn products. We also have no need to supplement him with wet food. When he is older, we'll switch to the adult cat version, which we used with our last cat, who happily ate it despite having only four teeth!",
            "These are for people that cannot tolerate sugar. They are not low cal, just slightly lower cal. The regular Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels made with sugar average 15 calories per piece or 60 calories per 17.3 grams, which is 4 pieces. The sugar free version averages 12.5 calories per piece or 50 calories per 16.5 grams, which about 4 pieces. Thatt's 20% fewer calories per piece.<br /><br />They are slightly softer as the regular Rios and much less sweet and much less flavorful. In terms of flovaor, there is no comparison -- the regular are rich; the sugarfree are bland, emphasis on the  bla . Eating these is a big sacrifice for 20% fewer calories. If you want to reduce caloric intake, the if you can work up the discipline to skip one piece for every 4 you eat, you total enjoyment might be much greater with the 20% fewer calories.<br /><br />They are made with real coffee and milk and Splenda sweetener, and other things.<br /><br />If you have partial fillings or crowns or braces, etc. you will want to avoid chewing these even though the are sotftler than the sugared version.<br /><br />For more general review on the Rio coffee candy, se my review of Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels.",

I have to say that out of them all,  Clipper  is by far the best!!  The taste is not overpowering, it's very mellow and pleasant (and it didn't make my tongue feel overly dry)!  It also didn't stuff my nose up (which could have been a possible chemical allergy to the other ones).  The price was fantastic as well (a little over $2 a box)-- especially considering it's organic AND fair trade!!<br /><br />In conclusion I'm extremely impressed; and anxious to try more teas from this company!",

Our local shul didn't have these Neriot candles and other places online charged as much for shipping as the cost for the candles.<br /><br />These were a great deal, 4 boxes here for the price of 2 elsewhere, plus free prime shipping.  They arrived quickly and the box we opened look good - no noticeable broken candles or other damages.  The boxes look a little different from the photo, but the brand is called  Menora - The Candles Word  with a PO Box from Tel Aviv, which I assume is where these were made since it doesnt list any place of manufacture.  The box lists the candles as kosher.<br /><br />You need to burn these in a special glass, and we haven't lit any of these to confirm the 4 hour estimate, but will report back if the time is much less than 4 hours.<br /><br />So far, very glad to have found these on Amazon.  4 boxes will last us at least a year, probably 2.",

I only buy the purest and best olive oil, for taste and to get all the therapuetic health effects that I now know about.....no wonder Americans don't understand the effects, they don't receive the effects! The US is the biggest market for inferior oils. The DeCarlo's have a top notch, quality operation and are passionate advocates, supporting olive oil production as a culture to be carefully maintained.  Why risk buying anything else but the very best? I anxiously await further regulation of olive oils, either by Italy or the US, to clean up the olive oil industry.",

These have already been prepared for you but you can still add your own olive oil and any other spices you may like to them. The flesh of these olives after being cured is meaty with a slight bitter to them. They play off the almonds very well. The almonds in this mixture are soft, smooth (almost creamy) and offset the slight bitter in the olive. I prefer to eat one or two olives and then follow up with an almond. You can even eat both simultaneously. The olives do have pits so be careful. Don't just bite down into one or you may damage a tooth. Eat the flesh of the olive off of the pit. I prefer to add some of my own extra virgin olive oil but it is up to your individual taste. This would go great on an antipasta tray or served with some cheeses and maybe some wine. Buon Appetito!",

            "Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0002DGRSY >Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.",

The only thing I didn't like is the artificial apple flavoring - it's a bit overbearing on the rest of the flavor of the bbq (almost of the point of tasting  jolly rancher  like).<br /><br />In all an ok sauce, 3 stars. -1 star for high fructose corn syrup, -1 for too much apple flavor.",

            "I was introduced to this excellent product during the Jewish season of Yum Kippur in December, when my local Ralphs market had a promotion of special foods for that holiday.  It is rare to find bottled salad dressings made with olive oil, rather than canola oil, soy oil, or safflower oil, which are the three major allergens.  Most people don't even realize they have allergies to these oils, but they could have a stomach ache after eating some.  I bought a number of these bottles when they were on special.  I have noticed that the bottles vary greatly with the amount of green flecks enclosed inside the bottle.  Some have a great deal, and others are almost green-fleck free.  I prefer the bottles with more green flecks, but I'm happy enough with those that have just a few.  Clearly, this is one of the very best commercially prepared salad dressings available.  The front label indicates gluten free/dairy free.  The ingredients are simple enough:  water, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, cider vinegar, salt, xanthan gum, garlic, onion, potassium sorbate (preservative).",

I was surprised to see that that was not at all the case. The item shipped from within the continental US. Ive purchased a lot of stuff online and I think this was the highest Ive ever had to pay for shipping. Maybe the seller incurs a lot of import fees and that could raise the price that they charge for shipping but I still think that almost three times the price of the actual item is again, rediculous.",

They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes:  From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest. <br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes.

Since chili powder is not merely ground chiles, but a blend of other spices -- including salt -- it may not be for everyone, but we seldom need to add anything else to our recipes when using this chili powder. We also haven't been able to find smoked chili powder anywhere else. It is priced right and the shipping is reasonable.",

Be careful because they are addicting and if you eat too much of the pistachios you will be taking in a lot of calories. At least they are not empty calories because pistachios have fiber, iron, calcium & potassium & unsaturated fats. Subscribe and save makes these pistachios a good deal.

Then, on a '12 trip to New Zealand, I rediscovered its smooth rich goodness once more.

            "For those who haven't experienced torrone almond honey nougat candy, you are in for a treat. This Italian specialty confection is authentic and a product of Italy. Although it looks like it will be hard and/or sticky, it is miraculously soft. Each piece is sealed in foil for freshness and carefully packaged in a small box like a gift. There are eighteen tiny boxes per 6.35 ounce package. When I was a child, after eating the candy, I would keep the little boxes and use them to store special treasures. I have added a photograph to show the individual packaging for each piece of candy.<br /><br />Only 45 calories per piece and 3 grams of fat with only half a gram of saturated fat, as far as candy goes, this is surprisingly natural. The candy is loaded with toasted almonds and flavored with vanilla, orange or lemon.  A distinctive very thin white wafer coats the front and back of the rectangle providing a satisfying lightly crisp texture. Torrone has a short ingredient list with toasted almonds as the first on the list and chemical additives thankfully absent, so there are no artificial colors or preservatives.<br /><br />There is nothing else like this Italian confection.  It is usually reserved for holidays, and I know in my house it wouldn't feel like Christmas or Easter without it, although it is certainly wonderful year round.  Ferrara's torrone would make a lovely hostess gift or an unusual treat to tuck into a Christmas stocking.",

            "Been using this product for a few months now and have been very happy with it.  It stores easily in my gym bag in single-serving foil pixie sticks.  I add it to my water bottle right before I step on the treadmill.  It keeps me hydrated better than plain water--I sip on it as a motivational reward for every 6 minutes of my 60 min workout.  It was a decent deal at $4.99, but a steal at $1.99/box (Black Friday)--I bought 20 boxes for $40!<br /><br />There is a new water coming out called Activate. 10K is much more cost-effective way to go.<br /><br />This only comes in Lemon-lime, which is fine for me.  Taste is ok, but has a bit of that artificial sweetener flavor--not too much, though.<br /><br />In summary, it's super convenient to take with you and the single-serving is handy.  It tastes good, cheaper than Gatorade and you can use your favorite bottled/water.  More refreshing than water due to its electrolytes.  Highly Recommend it!",

It replaces the salt you have lost from sweating and the potassium helps your muscles not cramp.<br /><br />This is an ideal drink for those lighter workouts or if you are diabetic and need to get refreshed quickly but don't need a lot of sugar. It contains the same electrolytes and hydration as the original Gatorade with � the calories and 1/3 of the carbohydrates.<br /><br />It is great for those hot summer days.

            "I've been addicted to these bars for some years, buying them at a local supermarket, and breaking off a square now and then through the day as a treat.  The orange flavoring complements the creamy medium cacao (54%) chocolate wonderfully. If you are an orange-chocolate fan, melt a square in your mouth and enjoy.  I find the orange flavoring superior to that of other organic chocolate bars with orange flavor or bits of orange zest.  If you want a truly dark chocolate taste, you'll have to look elsewhere though.<br /><br />(I came across these bars after my favorite treat was no longer distributed in the US - a much darker organic chocolate covering bitter orange/orange-zest jellies.  They were killer good.  While this doesn't compare, it mostly satisfies my orange-chocolate cravings.)",

It truly reminds me of the chocolates I used to get as special treats on the holidays; before companies started adding so many preservatives and waxes to candies, forever ruining their flavors.

However, I don't like the taste of the extremely pungent fennel seeds so Spicy World's gives me exactly what I want-enough crunch and just enough zing of fennel flavor.  Unless you have a strong stomach(like me), I would not recommend snacking on these raw(maybe mix them with sunflower seeds and raisins..may seem a bit unusual for snacking..great fiber, helps with your digestive system..endless benefits!)

It tasted sour when used to coat some breaded skinless boneless chicken breasts (with an egg wash as a binder), and did not hold texture at all in frying or baking (as a baking coating it got pretty soggy).  We tried it in a meatloaf recipe as well, and it added a strange sour, almost bitter, aftertaste to it.  This is simply not a good product to my taste buds.  The only reason I did not give it a 1 is that some people's tastes may vary, and the company itself did a good job on order fulfillment.<br /><br />If you're looking for crumbs, you're better off buying Dixie's  Bakes Quick  biscuit mix, then making biscuits and then making crumbs from those.  Its what I did before, and what I will do from now on.<br /><br />If you're looking for a frying coating/batter, go with Dixie's  Batter and Coating  mix - its a far better product.

The garlic lover's will love the taste. The asiago does play in the background as well. I followed the recipe and decided the mayo is useless.

            "This is the first review I have ever written about a product, and I have bought over 300 to 500 items from amazon. I just wonder who packs these boxes? When you advertise a variety pack of 60 with 7 different cereals, one thing that does not come to my mind, is somebody packing the box with what you feel like giving them. Not everybody's favorite cereal is frosted flakes in my case, and or raisin bran for somebody else buying this product. When you spend $56.00 for 7 different kinds of cereal, that's what you think your getting, not what they have more on hand of at the time. There should be an equal distribution of each kind, and if they can not do this please specify this in the product details so consumers are not mislead. Because if I wanted frosted flakes I would go buy a box at the store. The Variety idea is great, but the spending $56.00 for a mystery box of cereal is not. Thanks.",

            "There isn't too much one can say about this, other than it is great and a constant companion in my kitchen. It is basically minced garlic in a tube, and that's about it.  The consistency and flavor is roughly identical to garlic that has been through a garlic press.<br /><br />However, anyone who does a lot of cooking with garlic knows what a pain it is to peel and crush the stinking rose, and just grabbing this little tube saves you a lot of time and energy.  It substitutes just fine for any recipe requiring minced or crushed garlic.  Obviously, if you want big chunks then you still have to do it the old fashioned way, but this is one of those short cuts that actually work. In fact, it works so good it is surprising that this is an imported Japanese product, and not a regular US food item found in any grocery store.",

            "I purchased these rose petals for culinary purposes, to flavor tea infusions.  I felt this product wasn't bad, but not amazing.  I am a tea enthusiast and have considerable knowledge and experience with a wide range of teas, and have had better experiences with dried rose buds/petals.  The product's title and description indicated there would be rose BUDS, but I received only petals - not really what I was expecting, and had I known the description were inaccurate I would have passed on the purchase.  I've found rose buds offer a milder taste than rose petals, so the difference is something to be considered if you're familiar with the nuances between the two.  These petals in particular had a spicier taste than what I was looking for, though they do succeed in providing rose flavor.  I find that they're good when mixed with a straight-cut white tea and can last for two steepings before the flavor noticeably diminishes.  Personally, I favor mixing rose buds with oolong tea, but I find that flavor these petals yield isn't hardy enough to last multiple steepings with a darker tea - I tend to add an extra spoonful of them when making darker infusions.<br /><br />I think that for general needs (mine are admittedly specific), this product is adequate - I personally won't purchase them again, though I do plan on using the rest of my bag.",

The only negative I can come up with for this product is the amount of sugar used on the topping.  Other than that, this is the only muffin product I would buy.  We did try some other brands and they were absolutely horrible!!  If you're on a gluten free diet, give these a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Leave them in the freezer and take one out as needed.  WONDERFUL!!",
            "My son really enjoyed the Earth's Best line of baby food.  This flavor is nice and thick so it is easier to feed your baby.  Anything with apples tends to be thick.  The blueberry flavor is runny and messy!",

            "This is a reasonably priced balsamic vinegar.  It is great on salads.  I like it with olive oil on fresh cut tomatoes.  It is clearly not at the level of the more concentrated vinegars but at the same time one is not compromising the rent money for it.  good value",
            "On a trip to the grocery store a few weeks ago I picked up a bag of these Pretzel Crisps in the original flavor to try out, while my mother grabbed a bag in the garlic parmesan flavor. A few days later we each brought our new pretzels to one of my daughters softball games to snack on. As I ate mine, my mother insisted I try hers. Oh wow are these garlic parmesan ones good! It's not even a flavor I would normally have thought I would like, as I tend to like simpler flavors. But these are just so good, even a picky eater like myself love them. So on my next trip to the store I picked up 3 bags for myself and I'm snacking on them now.<br /><br />If you can envision a pretzel that has been rolled out flat with a rolling pin, that's what these are like. You get more of the crispy outside and much less of the white flour center you usually have with pretzels. Because they have a flat design, they even work as crackers. So you can top them with cheese, meats etc and use them with dips, just like you would a cracker, only they taste even better. They are very crispy, but don't crumble or fall apart when trying to eat them. The bags are resealable, and the seal works extremely well. The best part is since they have so much flavor, you can eat just a few and it feels like you've eaten a lot more. Lots of flavor is a smaller package.<br /><br />The nutritional info is:<br />Serving size: 10 crackers/pretzels<br />Fat: 1.5g per serving<br />Calories: 110 per serving<br />Carbs: 22g per serving<br />Sodium: 410mg per serving<br />And there is a warning that these are made in a facility that processes milk and soy, for those with allergies to them.",
            "I LOVE this stuff. Always drink my tea straight.<br /><br />Great tea flavor and the mint gives it a crisp, clean finish (the mint is alot heavier on the smell when you open the pouch than when you actually drink the finished product).<br />If you like green tea, and mint tea, this is a great vessel.<br /><br />I typically go through 4-5 bags a day and I like to mix-and-match with other flavors (Mango being my go-to).<br /><br />I tend to eat heavy breakfast and lunches that leave quite the mark on my breath. One cup of this and my mouth feels instantly-cleansed.<br /><br />Absolutely nothing bad to say about this. Never had a problem with teeth stains or any aftertaste.",

This flour also works well in cookie mixes or hardtack.",

            "Ready Brek was a treat when I was growing up in England in the 60's and 70's, and I occasionally buy it still. It is very finely ground oatmeal, and when mixed with water or milk tends to have the consistency of wallpaper paste (for those of us old enough to remember when you still had to slop paste on wallpaper), and the bland taste is probably similar too. Funny thing is, I like it! If you grew up on this, then try it for old time's sake; if you've never tasted it before, I can pretty much guarantee you'll find it to be gross!!",
            "I'd never tried sea vegetables before so I wasn't sure what to expect from this kelp, but several of my relatives have thyroid problems and after researching the matter I decided that adding iodine to my diet via kelp was a good idea.  When I received the product and opened a packet and saw that the kelp was covered with a white dusty substance I was horrified and assumed it was moldy but after reading the instructions--always a good idea!--I was informed that it's normal and is just salt and sugar substances produced by the kelp as it is dried.  This company claims that they voluntarily test for various kinds of contamination, so I was impressed by that. As for eating the kelp, I washed and inspected a piece of it, then snipped it into some chicken broth and gently simmered it for about 20 minutes.  It's a little chewy--imagine a really tough cabbage leaf--and seems salty, but I found it palatable and didn't get sick or anything.  In fact, I felt quite good the next day.  Don't know if that was down to the kelp, but I will keep on eating it.  Try it.",

It is fantastic. Not too sweet, tastes like grapefruit and is not made with artificial sweetener. Two thumbs up.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is it is messy. When trying to pour from the measuring lid into the bottle the syrup dribbles down the side, onto your pants, the bottle, the floor, etc. To fix this I now measure in the lid, pour it into a small measuring cup and then into the carbonated water.",

            "This is a really excellent seasoning.  I first had it at a Boy Scout camp in New Mexico, where it was around for every meal and was put on *everything*.  In an environment like a Boy Scout camp, where food is mass produced and isn't of the greatest quality, this stuff is essential.  It makes everything palatable, which is great.<br /><br />I didn't find the stuff again for about 10 years, when I was surprised to see it on the shelf of my local grocery store.  What amazed me that although it is excellent in making mediocre food better, it also makes *good* food taste better, too.  I don't use it on everything, like at camp, but it's great for things like seasoning home made french fries or potatoes.  It is a bit salt-heavy, so you should know that ahead of time, but if you like moderately salty foods you'll enjoy it.  If you haven't had this before, get a smaller, single jar before getting the large six pack.<br /><br />You should know that a six-pack of 17-oz jars is a LOT of seasoning, and the expiration date is about 2 years from manufacture - there's almost no way for a single family to eat this much seasoning in that time.  I bought this to give some away as gifts (my family loves this stuff too, and it's hard to find).  If you don't have any plans for these besides eating them yourself - look for a smaller package than this.",
            "I think there is a wrong description of this tea listed at the moment, this tea is made from the rooibos plant.<br /><br />I bought the tea since I do love the Japanese green matcha tea, but that is so energizing I don't want do drink it at night. Plus I wanted to try something new.<br /><br />I found that there are only about 3 companies who do sell red matcha. I tried this one from Red Leaf Tea since I saw that they had many different types of matcha available, even black and white matcha. So they appear to be matcha specialists! I sometimes cannot wait for my shipment of green tea to arrive from Japan, it takes so long. I was happy to find Red Tea and they are an American company, the shipping was fast!<br /><br />I love the red matcha, it has its own sweet flavor, I liked it without sugar or cream. It is very thirst quenching. I haven't tried it iced, but I read that it is wonderful as an iced tea or iced latte. I only bought the small size so I am conserving. I am using the rest to make just plain, I just add hot water and whisk or stir. It is absolutely delicious without anything added. It foams up pretty nicely also! I should have bought the bigger size from Red Tea. I was trying it for the first time.  Now I have another tea I like as much as green tea matcha!<br /><br />This red matcha is very healthy and FULL of anti-oxidants, even more so than green tea! It is a good tea to drink at bedtime since it is relaxing, but it also makes a good daytime tea.  I think this tea will be revitalizing if you need and relaxing if you want, it is unique.<br /><br />Try this: add some red tea matcha to warm milk or soymilk (any kind of milk) with your favorite sweetener. YUMM!<br /><br />I put some of the matcha in lowfat 1% milk with some vanilla agave syrup (I didn't have plain agave) and then used my espresso machine's steamer to foam the milk and create a delicious dessert.  I was a little embarrassed to try to get every little bit of foam out of my mug, so I made a second serving!  I still got every bit out of the mug at the end, that is how good it is!",

I've tried plenty of home made popover recipes and most of the time they came out flat, no matter which little tricks I tried.  This mix is easy to make- and they bake perfect every time!

            "I am a classically-trained singer with Type I diabetes, and I recently finished up a year learning a little about singing in contemporary styles. Over-singing suddenly became a big problem. I used to use honey in hot water to sooth my irritated throat, but that spiked my blood sugar, which in turn dehydrated me and my vocal folds - and that was completely counterproductive.<br /><br />My voice teacher turned me on to Yogi Throat Comfort, and I haven't gone back. Granted, honey tastes better; this tea has a very strong licorice taste that is almost unpleasant. It isn't anything I would reach for if I wanted to enjoy a cup of tea. However, it soothes an irritated throat EVERY BIT as well as honey, and even though I've stopped studying contemporary styles and don't have to worry so much about over-singing anymore, I still turn to this tea at the first sign of a scratchy throat. I've had colds that dropped my speaking voice more than an octave or left me essentially unable to speak, and this tea is an important part of a regimen that enables me to keep singing anyway.<br /><br />Have one of those now, in fact, which is why I'm back here to order more. :)",

The fruit is pretty much the size of a raisin and they are pretty tasty. They're not as thick and chewy as a normal fruit snack which is good since he doesn't have teeth. I'll probably keep them in the house a little longer for a nice alternative to cheerios when we go out, but once he has some teeth we'll move on to something else.",

            "I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!",

I used to order this brand in the knotted bones and my dogs loved them, but the company changed the recipe and now my picky dogs won't even touch them.  I have also bought the compressed rawhide chicken top bones, which my dogs like too, but they never chew the actual rawhide so it doesn't keep them busy for long.  I saw these online and thought I would try them - what a hit!! My dogs are so happy! They love the chicken tops and it seems to take a Little longer to chew off then the pressed rawhide bones do.  Also, the rawhide is thin enough that they even enjoy chewing that as well.  I hope they continue making these just as they are, they are fabulous!!!",
            "I originally received Bedtime tea as a gift and enjoyed it so much that I ordered it when I couldn't find it locally.  I believe it works primarily because it contains valerian which is also available in capsule form.  Valerian generally doesn't smell very good in a capsule but in this tea with Passion Flower Extract and other organic herbs it tastes great.  Some people report vivid dreams with valerian but that's not necessarily bad.  I don't have any morning grogginess and valerian is not associated with bizarre behaviors while asleep (eating, driving, etc) as some prescription sleep aids do.  As a rotating shift worker I have to be alert for either a day or night shift.  This helps me sleep when I need to and awake well rested.  I will definately order it again.",

They do work well in recipes with lots of other flavor.

            "I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like  Beneful  I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot:  When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.  Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.",

            "Earl Gray is my tea of choice; my absolute favorite.  That being said, I have to further state that this Gourmet Earl Grey offered by Adagio is the best of the best!  The aroma is enough to make me swoon.  (Actually, I am pretty good at swooning and many things other than tea cause the condition...I would have made a great Victorian Lady...well,  Lady  may be a bit of a stretch, but at least Victorian would be appropriate).<br /><br />Anyway, loose leaf is always the way to go if you have the time and are so inclined.  I like mine on the rather strong side and must admit to enjoying the smell of it steeping almost as much as I enjoy the drinking of it.  The oil of bergamot is not at all overwhelming and is far superior to some of the stuff they add to tea these days...there is not after taste and the aroma does not linger for three days afterwards.<br /><br />Recommend this highly. The price here, when you consider the tax situation and the 50 mile drive I have to take to get to my source, is quite competitive.",

I wasn't sure if she'd like this at first so I bought a smaller amount. But she said this particular tea is very fragrant and has a great taste. Green tea is probably one of the best teas: chocked full of antioxidants and benefits if you drink it without cream and excessive sugar. Enjoy.",
            "This Sharp Provolone cheese is soooooo good. I have always been partial to the provolone cheese when I buy it at the deli in the grocery store, but that is Mild Provolone. When I saw that 'For The Gourmet' had Sharp Provolone on their list of available purchases, I was intrigued. I tried it, and boy, am I glad I did. I think it is much better than Parmesan in the tangy-ness and strong-ness you can get from just about any cheese. I think I even like it better than an extra sharp, or seriously sharp cheddar cheese. Although, those are really good, too. It ads so much flavor and you don't have to use much of it. That is why I like Parmesan, but Pramesan is so much harder and dryer. This will melt much better. Don't hesitate to try it. It is really delicious.",

They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.",

We read that it's a low acid coffee (guess they have some coffee shops on the west coast, but none here where we are) and several people (including me) have noted that they haven't had any stomach troubles since we started drinking this. We had a little hiccup with the initial shipment (missing 10 bags and the individual bags weren't labeled -- reason for less than 5 star review), but Amazon was great about taking care of this and we plan to continue to get this coffee. Great find for the price!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Got our second shipment today and all the items were in the box -- still not individually labeled, though.

The first few times I cooked it in the microwave, it exploded all over the place and left a sticky mess (Cooked it on high for 3 minutes as the instructions read). Covering it with a plate or foil does not help. I figured out that stirring after the 1st and 2nd minute prevents it from boiling over. You do have to let it sit for several minutes before it's cool enough to eat.<br /><br />The texture of this cereal is very grainy, which can not be helped by adding more liquid. I add splenda and fat free yogurt to give it better taste and texture, sometimes I slice some banana into it before I cook it.<br /><br />I prefer Bob's organic 6 grain and the 5 grain cereals over this.",

More than once, I left a piece in my jacket pocket by accident and found my dog chewing the pocket to get to them.

            "First off, I'd like to note that this would normally be a five star review if I were simply reviewing the product itself, but I am also taking into consideration Amazon by dropping the review by one star.<br /><br />I switched my dogs over to Taste of the Wild Hi Prairie formula when Amazon decided to jack up the price of the Natural Balance formulas I used to purchase (the Bison and Venison ones) by ten dollars.  I was hesitant to spend fifty-five dollars on a bag of food when my two dogs go through almost three bags a month, but the two-day shipping made it seem worth it, particularly since the nearest PetCo (the only store in my area that seems to carry Natural Balance) is almost ten miles of slow-moving traffic away.  However, spending almost seventy dollars on a single bag of dog food is just too much, so I decided it was time to change brands.<br /><br />Luckily, my first choice turned out to be a success.  I swapped my dogs over to Taste of the Wild over the course of three or four days and their stool has remained solid, something that has always been an issue for my Boxer (with Natural Balance being one of the few premium brands that worked well for him).  Really, the only issue I have with Taste of the Wild is that the food smells a bit strong, but when the results are there it's hard to complain much about having to catch a nasty whiff of it a couple of times a day during feeding.  My dogs seem to love it, though, and are eating with a bit more enthusiasm than they did previously.<br /><br />As I said, the score was dropped one star for Amazon's handling of the product.  First, this product actually costs about four dollars more than it does in my nearby store (it is sold in a small, locally-owned dog bakery for $49), which is only a block away.  Second, for whatever reason Amazon does not offer two-day shipping via Prime for this item.  For me, this is the bigger issue, as I typically order a new bag right when I need it rather than stockpiling them.  With the unpredictable nature of standard shipping options, it's almost impossible for me to continue to order this product from Amazon.<br /><br />That said, you can't go wrong with this product if you have dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies.  It's one of the better grain free foods that I've come across and works great for both of my large breeds (a Boxer and a German Shepherd).  Just check in your area and see if you can't find somewhere that sells it a bit cheaper.",

Another thing which I can't stand, is the awful taste of this drink! I don't even know if it is effective as an energy drink because I couldn't ever manage to finish a whole can of the stuff. The first sip I took was utterly putrid. I tried mixing it with some mango nectar to cut out the terrible taste, but you shouldn't have to dilute your beverages to make them easier to consume!<br /><br />Save yourself (and your taste buds!) the horror and don't buy this drink. I have tried over 20 different energy drinks and this is the most foul one of them all! Ick.",

Happy with the bags also. Needed scissors to cut open, but hey, they aren't all broken into pieces because of the strong bag.

But, I'm not overly fond of the bitter taste of most green teas - especially when cold. And as the summer months approach I don't want to be slurping on hot tea.  So having read the reviews I bought these as I love fruity cold drinks.  These do have a lovely fruity flavour.  However, I can see that it may be too sweet for those who were still looking for a green tea taste to balance the sweetness. I can barely taste the green tea and it's usually in the aftertaste not while I'm drinking. Even though I like the flavour I think if I drank more than 1 bottle a day it would probably even be too sweet for me.",

            "Seattle's best numbering system is honest.  I like stronger coffee so I've tried the 3, 4, and 5.  The number 3 is coffee, regular strength normal everyday coffee.  It's a good flavor, not acidic, smooth flavorful, coffee. The number 4 is strong coffee, same basic flavor as the number 3, just stronger.  It's like using a full pot worth of grounds and only brewing three quarters of a pot.  My favorite is the number 5.  Number 5 is different.  Number 5 is extremely strong flavor!  Do not use a normal amount of grounds to brew a pot, unless you're really stubborn, you'll dump the pot.  It is good though, if you use about half the normal amount of grounds you get some very tasty coffee that you can actually drink.  I bought three packs of number 3 and 4 for work.  I brought in a bag of number 5 once, but that was a big mistake.  You see not everyone understands how to brew number 5 and I had some unhappy co-workers including one that spit a mouthful at his computer screen.  Yes, it's funny now, but it wasn't then.",

            "I have been using Giovanni Body Wash (White Tea scent) for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne, rashes and irritations when using most other soaps. I have wasted tons of money trying soap after soap hoping to find something that wouldn't irritate my skin, lathering well, while leaving me feeling clean. This soap has a really nice, soft scent, washes skin clean of dirt and oil and leaves no soap scum after rinsed off. This is the only soap I have found that does not cause break-outs/irritations and lathers well. I truely wish I could find a more econonmcal product that does the same job as this body wash but still haven't found one. So I try to find really good deals when buying this body wash to help off set the cost.<br /><br />Please note: this soap is a little drying.. so if you already have a dry skin conidtion this may not be the soap for you. I lived in a very warm humid climate when I started using this soap and did not notice the drying effect until I moved to a much cooler and dryer area. With that being said Giovanni also sells one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, it's their body butter (comes in the same scents as the body washes). This body butter works fantasticly! I am in the health care field and have to wash my hands many, many times a day. If I put some of the body butter on at night right before I go to sleep, my hands are moisturized all the next day without reapplying! I have tried many moisturizers that seems to work great until you wash your hands, then its like you never had any on in the first place... the body butter is not like this.",

They were delivered very quickly, and are a dull brown color, which I expected because of the lack of sulfites.  Unfortunately, they are extremely bitter, and even though I expected the flavor to improve when I rehydrated them with water, they retained the bitterness. I tried soaking them in olive oil as well, and this also did not do much to improve the flavor.  Amazon advertises these as sun dried but in fact, they are not sun dried and are air dried instead.  I don't know if that has anything to do with the flavor, and I was unable to find out any other information about the company, Sonoma. Therefore, I would not recommend these tomatoes. :(",
            "First, my cat loves this treat.  However, it is definitely not a dental product as the manufacturer advertised.  There is no enzyme in Greenies that would promote dental health.  The size of the treat is pretty standard compares to other brands of cat treats, so there is no need for the cat to chew on it (my cat swallows it in 2 seconds), which means Greenies does not  brush off  the tartar either.  I took my cat to the vet few months ago for professional dental cleaning.  After the treatment, the vet gave me some handouts about dental care for cats, and explained to me that Greenies does NOT promote dental care.  Instead, the vet recommends the CET chews for cats.  However, the vet says, nothing beats brushing your cat's teeth at least every other day.  So, if you are looking for an oral hygiene chews, look somewhere else, however, if you just want to please your cat, Greenies does make a tasty treat!",

            "I bought this tea as a gift for someone who had it at a tea and liked it. Since it came in six canisters, they gave me one.<br /><br />I was expecting white tea. This is not a white tea. It is not a good Ceylon tea either. It is easily overpowered anything you add to it. The tea tastes like water with a very sight hint of pomegranate. Even though the tea liquor is very dark, no flavor. This is advertised as a white tea but it isn't. When you brew a decent white tea, no matter how much tea you use, it still stays light and has a grassy, nutty taste. This is a Ceylon but not in the English Breakfast sense because it did not have enough edge like a good Ceylon or Assam have.<br /><br />When brewing it, I brewed it like a white tea. 160 degree water. It turned dark brown immediately so i knew it wasn't a white tea. The next time i made it i brewed it like a straight up black tea. No flavor. Tried two bags. Still not great. Watery with a very, very sight hint of a fruity taste in an 8oz cup.<br /><br />It comes in a round canister like Republic of Teas but inside is a vacuum sealed aluminum bag with all 50 of the tea bags smashed together. Inspecting the bags found very ground up tea powder. After brewing, no leaves in sight, just a lump of tea dust. I guess this is why it turned color so fast.<br /><br />I take tea with no sugar or milk. I guess if you add enough sugar, any tea can taste decent. This tea just didn't work for me on any level.<br /><br />You may want to try the Rishi or Bentleys. They are more expensive but they taste better. You may be very underwhelmed by this tea compared to them.",

Packages are zip locked and have a small stay-fresh insert to keep the treats moist.  They are small, maybe the size of your thumb, and they're chewy and smell pretty good, unlike other dog treats we've tried.  I am not happy with the pricetag on these goodies, however, and finding them in stores is hard to come by.  Buying them online is costly enough but then adding the shipping fee puts the purchase way over the top for a simple dog treat.  If they would come out with bulk package, I'd justify the higher price tag, but this sized bag is just a rip off.",

            "Woodford Reserve has a cult following and it's easy to understand why: it has a lean, semi-dry, aspect that emphasizes herbal and botanical notes and downplays the resiny fruity  candy corn 'aspect one often finds in bourbons.  It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18.  It's lovely.  Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco.  There's some leather and cream too.  First sip opens bright with honeyed corn.  Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect.  Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke.  It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best.  The absence of  corn likker  fruitiness is most appreciated.  This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.",

I ordered it for my wife in the hopes that it would be her gateway matcha drug, but she really doesn't like matcha, so it will likely be a bust (though she'll be a good sport and try it anyway). But I'm only a citrus fan to a point, that point usually being grapefruit. Mmm, grapefruit.<br /><br />When I first started mixing it, it smelled like a mix between Lemonheads and lemon cleaner. But the sip is pure lemonhead. It tingles down my tongue! It's tasty in its own way, and if you're into Lemonheads and the like, I would definitely recommend this to you. My wife has a coworker who loves lemon, so this matcha might be hers after another cup or two. It has a lemony bite that someone who enjoys lemons and sour candy might love. It's more of a mild vegetal flavor than a stronger matcha, which my wife appreciates in a matcha. The lemony bite can be cut with a touch of sugar, so while I can see that this matcha would be right up the alley of a lemonhead lover, it's just not the tea for me.

            "Used it in a recipe for pulled-pork.  Had never heard of it before and couldn't find it locally.  Ordered it and Himalayan sea salt from Fairies Finest.  I'd procrastinated and was afraid it wouldn't arrive in time, so I called and they promised to get it in the mail right away.  Showed up in 3 days.<br />The salt has undertones of clay, which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe.  The liquid smoke overpowered it, but the flavor was there.  I think it best used as a rub or finishing salt.<br />There is also black Hawaiian salt... somehow mixed in with lava!  Have to try that next...<br />P.S.  The salt was well packaged in a jar.",

He did, but now I am addicted and trying to find a source to purchase more in my area of the mid-west.<br /> The best description is the flavor is complex with several different notes. First you get sweet, then a sour and spicey but fruity undernote followed by a nice but not too hot burn. Also the sauce has a great texture with pieces of onion complementing the flavor.<br />  Great sauce, if I had one complaint...why so many artificial ingredients, i.e hydrolized protien, etc..??",

I've always heard it called  shichimi , the alternate pronunciation of seven (nana). There are 7 spices in here. In Japan, the mix contains hemp seed, which has been replaced in the US market with orange peel.<br /><br />It's great over yakitori skewers, pizza, ramen, or anything you want to add a little dash of flavor too. Spiciness is very very mild.",

            "I bought a box of these a few months ago at my local grocery store during my  let's try the many different varieties of Cheez-Its  plan.  At first I was unsure how I felt about the smoked ones, but after the box was gone I really craved them.  I love the Monterey Jack ones, but I love the Smoked Cheddar differently.  My brother didn't like the smoked ones, and it certainly depends on your personal taste.  I read a review here that said they taste like a campfire - that is sort of true, but not exactly a bad thing in my opinion.  They taste smoked because they ARE smoked.  If you do not like smoked foods (like my brother) you will not like these, and if you think the sound of smoked cheese sounds bad you really should try another Cheez-It variety.  These are (currently) my favorite Cheez-Its and I hope they continue to make them for a long time.<br /><br />As for the price here right now: that I give a 1 star.  My local grocery store sells these for about $4 to $5 a box (13.7 oz).  I only buy them when they are on sale, usually $2.50 to $3 a box.  The price from Amazon right now is $25 for 4 boxes of the same size, which makes these $6.25 a box.",

            "Whoa...in doing my research I noticed that one box of South Beach Diet Bar Fiber Granola Bar (that's a mouthful isn't it) costs $23.92 if you order it on Amazon. I have prime but I realize that not everyone does so if you factor in another couple bucks for shipping...ridiculous price. I'm not sure how much a box of this costs in stores (considerably less I would hope) but I daresay that it is unlikely that the price is worth the product. If anyone could use a good diet bar it's me but the problem with diet bars is in the name. They are DIET bars. They aren't supposed to taste great (otherwise you'd be in danger of eating the whole box and what kind of diet is that) so instead they usually taste like a mix of cardboard and...well more cardboard. Now the South Beach Diet Bar Granola Bar isn't THAT awful. Don't take that delicious looking beast on the package for truth. The real product is much flatter...And the taste? Well it tastes exactly what you would think a chocolate diet bar would taste like. It's unfair for me to bash a diet bar based on taste after admitting that diet bars aren't SUPPOSED to taste good but that image on the package really got my hopes up.<br /><br />But how effective is the bar? Effective enough. I ate one this morning and I didn't eat again till later this evening. That's not really praise for the diet bar, I have a pretty hectic schedule. But maybe I didn't notice the hunger as much. I'm guessing I could eat a granola bar (get better taste at a cheaper price) and be the same level as hungry. So if you take diets/diet bars seriously then this might be the bar for you. It doesn't really have anything to separate it from the other snack bars out there other than the South Beach name but hey, what do I know?",

They have a more intense sour experience, which is my favorite. Sour Patch Kids and that type of candy doesn't do it for me. But this gum is awesome, minus a couple things: the 5 ball tubes make me eat them faster (don't want to leave it open very long) and the flavor only lasts for 5 minutes or so (even though the flavor is great). But the reason I went with the 5 ball tubes is because they were cheaper, per unit, than the individually wrapped version. Love this gum!",

Also, the lomo had a deep fold across the length of it (a small fold is normal), which coupled with the hard texture made it difficult to serve to guests (even the fat around the edges was hard).<br /><br />The flavor was good, but it was not excellent.<br /><br />Next time, I will buy the Iberico again. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's smoother, has better flavor, and a lot easier to cut and prepare for serving guests.",

            "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it  healthy,  instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",

When I tried adding the usual honey, it just didn't taste the same. So, I found out that this Attiki is the kind Fage uses, and I ordered it. It is truly heavenly.

            "I know, I know. These reviews are nothing but memories, but I can't help it! If I can drink a tasty drink that is good for me, gives me energy, and makes me think of happy things, well, why wouldn't I? This one is all my grandmother and my father. Every Thanksgiving, my grandmother would let us drink cranberry juice mixed with ginger ale, and we felt so grown up. So grown up! It's still my preferred way of drinking cranberry juice, and when the cranberry ginger ale is released around the holidays, all I do is think of her. Her son, my father, is a ginger ale memory for me too, it's his favorite soft drink. Vernor's, if you've got it, or Schweppes, but Canada Dry will do in a pinch and make him think of me anyway. When my wife is ill, it's ginger ale, if you please, not lemon-lime anything. You know that old adage that girls always search for someone like their father? It's so true in my case...my wife and my father are amazingly alike. So when I spotted it on the Red Leaf tea website, I had to grab it for my campaign to get her to like ginger ale. Who knows, I might convert my dad with it when he comes up to visit next!<br /><br />This is wonderful. Ginger and I are not the best of buddies, but I'm coming around to it. This reminds me of a local ginger ale found only in Middle Kentucky called  Ale-8-1 . It's full of ginger flavor, but in a very good way. If you get this one, don't be put off by the overwhelming ginger smell, it's not nearly as strong as it smells, which is a good thing to me. It would definitely be a matcha I reach for when I'm headed into work with an upset stomach, but need a pick me up. I don't think it's one I'll keep in stock, but it's not one I'll be actively trying to swap away either. I'm excited to try it with the cranberry. If you're familiar with ginger ale brands, it's more of a Vernor's than anything else. Lord have mercy, I spend way too much time with ginger ale, apparently. But if I can talk my Dad into trying matcha, this will definitely be the one I lead with. Who knows, my father in law greatly enjoyed the French Vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea, maybe my dad can be won over as well!",

Lastly, I love that you get vitamins and minerals and it's good for your heart.

I have a hard time seeing that they have are anything but white unless I am really close, and when I used them on white icing they weren't really noticeable. Bummer. I guess on darker frosting you would still get some impact and if I had to choose between artificially colored sprinkles or these I would still go with these.",

Normally I can have a little of it and it doesn't bother me but this bothered me so much, I had a hard time breathing.  So I donated it.  I didn't think I could send it back as I had already opened one package and I have epilepsy so I can't really get to the post office anyway.

Although I am not a fan of flax, it DOES provide a delicious nutty flavor when I use the right amount (like 2-4 tbs in a recipe).  It's also nutritious and contains omegas, so that's another reason why I love using it.  I think it tastes great in recipes using peanut butter, maple or chocolate.",
            "*****<br />This Green Tea from Yogi Tea is a plain, but far from ordinary green tea. The taste is incredible. It is definitely the best green tea I have ever tasted---green tea as it always should be---full of flavor and freshness!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 100% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue by providing antioxidants. It contains 58mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee). Note that Yogi makes a Decaf Simply Green Tea, too, if you want to avoid the caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended. In the case of this tea, simplicity is bliss!<br />*****",

People always ask about my dressings and why they taste so good.  I think it adds a distinctive sweet/salty flavor that blends so quickly you serve immediately.  Before finding this source for purchasing it, I could only get it at the health food stores like Whole Foods, Sunflower, etc.  I used this price to get Whole Foods to give me a discount if I order through them instead.  I only saved a couple of dollars though and sometimes I would rather not give Whole Foods my money - that place is such a rip-off.

One must know how to properly brew tea as this isn't the tea dust you get in bags from the supermarket.  It takes 3 to 5 minutes of steeping because these are leaves not powder.  You can get the paper tea sacs from Amazon if you don't want to bother with a pot, but do give the tea time to release its flavor and you will be well rewarded.",

The salt isn't quite as fine as we expected... a bit many grained size, but they all come out of the salt shaker well.  We found out that our local upscale grocery store carries it in bulk, but it's  rock salt  size.  We've bought a Bodum grinder that grinds both pepper and salt for when the salt we have now runs out.  The Bodum is great and they sell it on Amazon...<br />P.S.

The cream foams up well in the Tassimo machine. The only difference in taste between this Cappuccino drink and the Starbucks Latte Primo is that the coffee flavor is slightly stronger in the Starbucks product. Also, with the Cappuccino you brew the coffee first and then use the milk disc. With the Starbucks Latte Primo you brew the milk first then the coffee.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a bargain buy. As long as you are not looking for a slightly stronger coffee flavor, I'd suggest purchasing this instead of the Starbucks brand as both products use expresso coffee and milk discs.",

Some of the reasons I love this: it doesn't  become completely mushy, has a nice texture. Not crunchy, though. The flavor is nice, but I add brown sugar and frozen blueberries and cook with half milk/half water (of course not frozen once I eat them). Another great thing about this cereal is that it cooks quickly, comparing to steel cut oats. If you're a hot cereal fan, you'll like this, if not...send it to me.

Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period.

Although I am a bit confused and uncertain over what the actual fat content of a bag is (read the label of unpopped kernals v.s. popped corn--whaat?); as near as I can tell it is 2g of fat per popped bag, which yields approximately 3 cups of popped corn.  Excellent!  Since this is kettle corn, it is a great fix for a sweet tooth that also wants a crunchy snack.  I was pleasantly surprised, & will have this in my cupboard 24/7 for those snack-attack moments without guilt.  Definitely give this one a try!",

I chose the Oatmeal Raisin and found it to be a nice soft, flavorous cookie, individually wrapped and ready to be taken on the go for a reasonable snack. It did not crumble apart as it was held and eaten by an 18 month old, yet was soft and easily chewable.  Each cookie has 110 calories with 1 g of saturated fat and 6 g of sugar--better than many of the snacks available.  I was not impressed, however, with the price as I paid $2.69 for an 8 pack box on sale.  However, I will stock up on these when they are on sale again as the only allergens they contain are wheat and soy, making them among the few ready-to-eat snacks that my nut allergic granddaughter can have.  We are so excited to have found them for her and they make her feel  just like the other grandchildren  when I hand out snacks...Thank you Nabisco.",

            "As winter approaches, I feel moved to share one of my secrets<br />for satisfying winter stews that are not excessively fatty.<br />You can use the bitter tang and the concentrated flavor and<br />fattiness of unsweetened chocolate to add a dimension to almost<br />any stew that will delight ( and mystify ) your guests. For a<br />two quart stew pot or brasier, add about two ounces of<br />Bittersweet Scharffen Berger Chocolate and a tiny amount of hot<br />pepper.<br />Of course, this is not really a secret-Mole Poblano has used these<br />ingredients for years. But some prejudiced connection of chocolate<br />with dessert prevents us from using chocolate as a spice.<br />Why Scharffen Berger? Here's a story:<br /><br />My European friends are mildly snooty about some of their<br />local products-all of which, in their eyes-are infinitely<br />superior to their American equivalents. A few years ago, I<br />started carrying Scharffen Berger chocolate bars with me to<br />Europe-mostly the blue and yellow wrappers.<br />At one friend's house, I was always asked to make a mousse<br />au chocolate and so I, naturally, used the Scharffen Berger<br />even though my host had put out a local (Austrian) brand.<br />The rave reviews that the mousse got-and continues to get-<br />are not based on the recipe, which is basic basic, but on<br />the remarkable complexity of these lovely chocolates and<br />particularly on their fruity overtones and beguiling winey<br />finish.<br />I hear that the company has been sold to Hershey, and so there<br />is no guarantee that the quality will remain as it is. For the<br />moment, I have to say that I think this is certainly one of the<br />three best chocolates in the world and maybe the best.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, wine writer New Short Course in Wine,The and the rich and velvety bang BANG: A Novel<br />which has decidedly spicy notes of its own.",

I am glad I got both as well because I contemplated if they would be too similar and not worth the cost of both however as much as I love both flavors, I had to do it and I have no regrets!<br /><br />This Almond matcha is sweet and nutty. The aroma is captivating!! My daughter was in the process of making macrons and decided she will add some almond matcha to them. Unfortunately we had to stop because we were out of parchment paper - can't use waxed .... so anyway off to the store we shall run and I am going to pick up more sparkling water because I want to make an Italian Creme Soda with this almond matcha which will be AMAZING! Frothed up lovely even in milk.<br /><br />I love that Red Leaf uses natural flavors!",
            "I bought this new product for my wife.  Having recently purchased a new Keurig<br />brewer, I bought Timothy's Colombian Decaf Coffee from Amazon.  What a neat<br />idea!!!<br /><br />Well, the Kahlua coffee product was announced, and I bought it in hopes it would be a nice after dinner beverage.  NOT SO !!!  I don't know what it tastes like,<br />but it certainly is not Kahlua / coffee.  We've tried to add all types of liquids to the coffee ( including real Kahlua ) with no success.<br /><br />MY recommendation is to pass this product up !!!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B002QGK2V8 >Timothy's World Coffee KAHLUA Original, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-cups (Pack of 2)</a>",

            "I had never cared much for green olives, that is until I went to Spain, and had Spanish olives. Wow! I did a 180 with their rich, delicious flavor, so I only buy green olives from Spain (and olive oil too!).<br /><br />I was looking forward to trying these, but sadly, I found them to be extremely salty - and not as flavorful as others I've had.They would be good for tapenade, as the previous reviewer stated, or in a pasta sauce, or any  dish , as they will add flavor & salt (so you can adjust the final taste), and hold up well, however, I wouldn't recommend them as a superior  stand alone  to eat by themselves, which was the primary reason I bought them. I got them on sale, so at least the price was reasonable.<br /><br />I took off one point each for flavor, and too much salt<br /><br />Bottom Line: Suitable for recipes, don't recommend as a stand-alone olive for appetizer/snack.",

They are a pain in the thing that needs fiber bars <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B001ONVOC0 >FiberPlus Antioxidant Bars, Dark Chocolate Almond, 5-Count Bars (Pack of 12)</a>, and now I prefer this delicious alternative. This tasty Progresso soup is great, especially if you lack time to boil a chicken. To achieve a homemade flavor, simply add a dash of black pepper and marjoram. A dash of curry, thyme, or rosemary is delicious too.<br /><br />Since posting this review, Progresso has upgraded its cans: they feature tougher pull-tops to avoid opening during normal bumps of shipment/transport. You don't want your soup to arrive battered, dented, and soggy, due to poor can-design, you want to eat it. Enjoy!",
            "We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes. He looked like he was on his last leg, the cat not my brother-in-law. Anyway, we started supplementing his food with Newman's Own and I swear the cat looks 2 years younger. He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better. I am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a Vet has suggested. But if you have an animal who is not responding well, it is worth a try to add this product to their diet.",

            "I have been searching for unstabilized, organic, raw oat groats.  When I contacted the company to see if these were sproutable, they assured me that these oats were completely untreated- of course they would sprout!  Well, the company seems to be ignorant of the whole stabilized<br />/unstabilized oat dilemma, even after I explained it to them.  I bought 5# of these and, unfortunately, like so many other  raw  oat groats on the market, these will not sprout- they have been stabilized!<br />So if you are looking for sproutability, and I would encourage you to do so since soaking/sprouting creates a dynamic boost in nutrients and flavor, in addition to neutralizing the anti-nutrients which are in *all* seeds, nuts and grains.  This is an important factor in protecting and healing the gut.",

When there as been any cheese in this dish on most buffets, its texture has not at its best been much better than this (make your own paneer if you are picky and *have the time* - not difficult, just takes some time and effort).<br /><br />I don't consider it very spicy myself, but I can easily make it that way.

I had also ramped up to running 2-3 miles three times a week (from 1.5 to 2/ 2 times a week). When my cycle came and went with heavily reduced symptoms, I was in disbelief!! Next month, I switched to the PMS tea after day 20. The month after I had the PMS tea for the whole month. There is no looking back for me.<br /><br />Here are all the areas where I saw a SIGNIFICANT difference: Oily skin/hair, energy levels, I-AM-GOING-TO-CHEW-MY-NAILS-OFF cramps, bloating, body aches and the MOOD!<br /><br />Relevant asides:<br /><br />The PMS tea: doubled amount of Dandelion root (500mg compared to the Detox).  Caffeine free with 89% certified organic ingredients. Taste - meh...but tolerable<br /><br />The Detox tea: 250 mg of Dandelion extract. Apparently they revamped this product owing to concerns of sustainable access to ingredients. That is pretty commendable I think! Plus whatever they did, rocks! Taste gets a 10/10. Has a small amount of Kukicha caffeine. And again, the formula is 85% organic.<br /><br />Both products contraindicated for pregnant (detox only of course) or breastfeeding sisters.<br /><br />If you do review the product, please add tags, to help resolve some of the confusion here :)<br /><br />Last but not least the six pack price is a steal. But get one at a local dealer first and read the fine print!!<br /><br />Good luck!",

I was a bit disappointed with this tea. I have a hard time tasting the coconut. The chocolate comes through, however. It depends on how much money is spent on the tin. If it is $15 for 20 satchels that is a bit pricey. Most of the other H & S teas are less than $10. I would have expected more of the coconut taste come through. One of the other reviewers thought it was strong. Well it might be for them, but I can barely taste it. I really like the taste combination in other things.

I have tried mixing other dry food that he really loves with this Eukanuba. What he does is push the Eukanuba out of his food bowl onto the floor and eats the other food. The only way I can get him to eat any of this dry Eukanuba food is to coat it with canned Eukanuba wet dog food, especially chicken. He will eat all the coated dry food but if there is any that did not get completely coated he won't gobble it down as he does the completely coated stuff.<br /><br />Eukanuba told my wife that this food is made in the USA and I really hate to give it one star.

This is not a very nutty flavor- choose Adagio's Chestnut if you're looking for that.  Rather, this is a subtle almond tea.  The flavor is not especially sweet, so it's good for both morning and evening consumption.  I'd probably have preferred a little more nuttiness, but I enjoyed this tea all the same.",

Although there are  real  vegetables in the ingredients list, they are very far down on the list. Additionally the vegetables in the crackers are part of a  dehydrated vegetable blend  and the vitamins you would expect to be in many of the vegetables (eg vitamin A in the carrots listed in the vegetable) are not much higher than in normal crackers.<br /><br />Questionable marketing and name aside, the crackers don't taste very good. I could barely taste a hint of onion and pepper, and none of the other vegetables listed on the crackers-I am guessing I tasted the onion only because onion powder is also listed as an ingredient. They have a strong wheat taste, which I thought was surprising since it lists enriched flour as the main ingredient. Additionally they had a very distinct cardboard taste once you have chewed them a few times.<br /><br />I will not be buying these again and I would not recommend them to anyone.<br /><br />Ingredients I got off the box: Enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine, mononitrate {vitamin b1}, riobflavin {vitamin b2}, folic acid), soybean and/or palm and/or palm kernel and/or canola and.or partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, dehydrated vegetable bled (contains carrots, onions celery, cabbage, red bell pepper, tomato, parsley), sugar, baking soda, high fructose corn syrup, onion powder, (flavor enhancer), natural flavor, artificial color, disodium guanylate (flavor enhancer).",

This cooks up in maybe fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Only drawback, which may not be a nuisance to you, is that preparation as directed uses two pans, one to boil the liquid ingredients and a second to griddle up the kasha with egg coating before combining the two into one pan.

Though this is something that can be reused by melting, not for the seeding for which I'd needed this. They were not agreeing for return for a product that reached me in a form that was not acceptable. I had to explain my need and purpose. They did not refund my previous shipment or tax nor did they pay for the return shipment. I ended up paying $25 for the return shipment. The product is a lot costly through this vendor. Actually double its price. I bought a 5kg block of the same chocolate from a local Callebaut vendor. Please research your local listings. Stop buying through these channels. If you want Callebaut chocolates, call the number in the callebaut website and get the contacts of the local distributor. While through this vendor the milk/white chocolate for 1kg costed me close to $50 with shipping, I bought the 5kg block from the local distributor for just $47!!",

Then I thought of trying Amazon and was delighted to find it here and at a lower cost than I had paid in the store!  I bought a 6-pack carton and have been enjoying it daily.

            "I bought these vanilla beans in 2007 and five years later they still made a delicious vanilla syrup. I've used them in other recipes although I found them difficult to open since they seem to dry out a bit. When I make vanilla syrup all I do is cut the beans into half inch pieces. To make a syrup bring two cups water and two cups granulated sugar to a boil. Add in eight cut up vanilla beans. When boiling lower heat so that the syrup is still rolling but more like a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes. You want a bit of the water to evaporate. Then turn off the heat and cover the syrup. Leave it overnight so more vanilla is infused into the syrup. Then strain it through cheesecloth and pour it into a prepared bottle. I use an old vanilla syrup bottle. When you make your own syrup you don't have to worry about preservatives and it tastes way better. You can then drizzle your homemade syrup over fresh fruit or put it in your coffee. Don't expect the syrup to be clear however. The vanilla beans do color the syrup a bit.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",
            "I've been using this product twice a day for four months and find it very helpful for blood sugar regulation. It gives me almost instant energy and I seldom  run out of fuel  as I used to. I blend it with half a banana in milk and add my daily vitamins and calcium.<br />I think the banana is the key to making a thick, non-gritty smoothie. Also, adding a couple of ice cubes makes it even better. I use one of those little hamilton beach 16oz blenders.<br /><br />May 2011 UPDATE: still using this product every day and think it's great. The only problem I had was losing too much weight - about 10 pounds because it replaces more caloric meals, so that's good if you want to lose weight, but not so great if you have a hard time keeping your weight up.",

            "TASTES LIKE THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY BE 100% JUICE!,<br /><br />JUICY JUICE'S MISSION: STOP BUYING SODA FOR YOUR KIDS: BUY JUICY JUICE, is a simultaneously self-serving and altruistic mission.<br /><br /> Juicy Juice Berry - A MOST PALATABLE VARIETY OF JUICY JUICY:<br /><br />This is one of my favorite varieties of Juicy Juicy. Why is it? It is very palatable and obviously very sweet. However, there is none of the high fructose syrup in it that is added to other punches. Afterall, this is 100% juice.<br /><br />So what's in this stuff?:<br /><br />Apple Juice, Grape Juice, Raspberry Juice (Water, Juice Concentrates) Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Citric Acid. It is the combination of juices in this blend that makes this taste like a treat. For children and adults too, who like the sweet taste of soda pop or sweetened punches, this product represents a much healthier and palatable alternative.<br /><br />For providing this excellent, anti-oxidant rich alternative, as a compromise between healthy beverages and sugar sweetened drinks, I feel that  Juicy Juice Fruit Berry  has easily earned a five star rating.<br /><br />Now if only there were a way to decrease the amounts of natural sugars without affecting the taste?!<br /><br />WHAT IS THE  JUICY JUICE  BRAND?:<br /><br />Libby's  Juicy Juice Fruit Berry, 46 fl oz  is part of a larger family of 100% juice products that has taken aim at the huge market share that Coke and Pepsi have carved out for themselves. Their target market is the youth of America. That, more than anything else, makes this and other Libby's products important. I first became aware of this targeting when I was watching the PBS program  Arthur  with my youngest child (who is named Arthur). At the end of the show there was a message from Libby's that said,  Juicy Juice Is Proud To Support Arthur . Since then I have regularly supported their 100% juice products, although I drink more of them than our Arthur does. Surprisingly, most  Juicy Juice  products are significantly less expensive than  Ocean Spray  and  Northland  juices, though I still buy some of those varieties as well.<br /><br />THE INEVITABLE COMPROMISE:<br /><br />Though many critics and health advocates have pointed out that fruit juices are naturally high in sugar and after processing, including pasteurization, lose many of their healthful properties, they still represent a healthful alternative to soda for children. Surprisingly this seems to be a controversial statement, but 100% juice [with a little Vitamin C added] does help to engender healthful eating habits which begin with the choice of beverage. It is also a good source of potassium and is an excellent thirst quencher.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that all of these juices taste very palatable to kids, probably because they are blended to taste sweet without any added sugar. Of course, it would be better to make your own juice, avoid pasteurization [made in a very clean environment], and include the natural vitamins, minerals and pulp, but who really has time. What's more, do you really think a child would drink such a homemade healthy brew? In the meantime, there is  Juicy Juice  and our children will most probably drink that thereby avoiding soda.<br /><br />LOOKING FOR MORE INFO?:<br /><br />To find out more about this product, see their website at  juicyjuice  on the world wide web.

            "This is a very nice soup for those watching calories and wanting a scosh less salt than is usual for Campbell's soups. It's a tomato-based soup with a light dose of rice, black beans, and chicken. It's not thick or chunky. I'd call it a medium-density soup. Enough broth to slurp for those who like a not-stewish soup. Not super hot or spicy, but flavorful all the same.<br /><br />I find that it's very nice on its own, but I prefer it with more black beans (I just add canned ones) and chopped tomato and a sprinkle of low-fat cheddar cheese. That really makes it into a nice light meal, satisfying and flavorful.<br /><br />But I think if you like tomato-based soups and a Mexican vibe, this will agree with your taste buds. I consider it a pantry staple for lunch now.<br /><br />I do find the regular cans of this tastes slightly better. Maybe heating it in the can transfers some of the metal taste. Not sure. But if you can find the regular cans, I'd go that route.<br /><br />One cup has 130 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 8 grams of protein, 20 grams of carbohydrates, 2.5 grams of fat ( 1 gram of those is of saturated fat.) It also has 480mg of sodium, and 800 of potassium. I add the low-fat (or fat free) cheese for both flavor and to up the protein to balance the carbs.<br /><br />I hope Campbell's keeps making these.

            "I have been eating healthy and using products with Splenda instead of sugar in them for many years. I have been using Aspen Mulling Spices even longer than that. As soon as there is the tiniest hint of cold in the air I start mixing this in to every drink I have. This year, for the first time, I decided to order the sugar-free version and I was extremely disappointed. First off.. while it isn't obvious anywhere in the Amazon ad, it is only 2oz compared to 5.65oz of the original. So nearly 1/3 the amount but for the same price (or even higher). I get if this was 10+ years ago and Splenda was still new and magical and a fad, but there are few other products out there anymore that charge more simply because they're made with Splenda. And to make it even worse, looking on the packaging where it gives you recommended amounts to use for different drinks, some of the amounts it suggests are now higher. For example: 1.5tbsp for Brandy on the original, but 2tbsp for sugar-free. So you'll also be going through this faster. And finally, to me, the taste just isn't the same. I'm not talking about Splenda vs sugar, I don't use real sugar in anything. But the actual product seems to be different. It is an extremely fine powder, closer to the consistency of powdered sugar, whereas the original is more like regular sugar or salt in consistency. Whatever they have done has completely changed the flavor profile to me. And again I'm talking about the taste of cinnamon, of cloves, etc, not how sweet it is.

            "I bought a pound of this Meow Mix Tender Centers for my cat at the local pet superstore near my house. And although she seems to like it, I have to give it a low rating. Here is why:<br /><br />This Meow Mix Tuna and Whitefish Cat Food is like junk food for my cat as it tastes good but has little nutritional value. It has inferior ingredients in the top 5 of the ingredients list (listed below), as well as the addition of artificial colors and controversial brewer's yeast, so no matter how much my cat might like this cat food, I really had to give it a low rating.<br /><br />To start with, the first two ingredients on the list are ground corn and corn meal. These supply no essential vitamins or nutrients to my cat's diet. Chicken by-product comes next, which is a less than ideal form of protein as it is made up of the bits of the chicken that are unfit for human consumption. Salmon meal and fishmeal do provide better forms of protein, but they are not the main ingredients and do not provide a satisfactory amount of protein for a healthy cat. Furthermore, the artificial colors are unnecessary, and the addition of brewer's yeast can cause allergies in cats.<br /><br />Meow Mix, a subsidiary of Del Monte, could have come up with something better!<br /><br />Top 5 Ingredients:<br />1. Ground yellow corn<br />2. Corn gluten meal<br />3. Chicken by-product meal<br />4. Soybean meal<br />5. Beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of Vitamin E)",

He loves the taste and is still asking for it at 2 1/2 years old. The ingredients have been carefully chosen and I appreciate the high nutritional value and clean product list. For moms just trying it out, be patient as the babies take a few tries to get used to the texture. we have really relied on this product and highly recommend it.",

            "I like this product but don't LOVE it...dips are notorious for being somewhat salty and that's why we like them, but this was outrageously salty. Even my husband, who never finds anything salty, complained. We ended up using twice the called-for amount of sour cream and it was just fine. So next time we make a batch of this dip, I'll just use half the amount of seasoning. In this way, I suppose, you get the item for half-price, since it lasts twice as long as it should per directions....but if you just mix per instructions and serve without tasting, your guests will complain!!!  Flavor is good, very peppery and  green  tasting, if that makes sense. Love this company and their products, just be warned, they can be strong.",

After discussing this with customer service at Pacific Natural Foods, I found out that this is their standard procedure.   Vanilla  and  Chocolate  both DO have straws, however, so if that is an issue you might want to consider purchasing those instead.  For what it's worth, Pacific did send me a pack of straws when I requested it at no charge, but it's certainly not something I would want to do every time.  The milk itself is fine.  No complaints other than the lack of straws for the  Plain  variation.",

            "I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000F4F95C >Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS >Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.",

The sulphuric salt definitely carries that egglike scent and flavor as the other reviews have pointed out. It definitely sounded interesting, which is why i bought this, and at around $7, i am pretty much always willing to take a chance on something unproven. I have tried it by itself, an some veggies, and mixed into almond milk quesadillas, and i cant say i hated it, but as i said before, i cant really decide if i liked it either. I think this one is very much a question of personal taste. I am vegan, and dont really miss eggs, so maybe that is part of it. Dont know. I do know that it is interesting, and i certainly wouldn't dissuade anybody from trying it. You might find it to be a five star product like the previous two reviewers did...and they arent wrong. As i say, this one in particular is a subjective thing. I dont know that there is a wrong rating for this salt. Some will love it, some will hate it, and some will be undecided like i am.",

The only problem is that when I compare the flavor of the canister pack product to the on-the-go packets, the canister seems a little weaker and more acidic. Maybe it's just my imagination, or it could be the concentration although I follow the directions for both products. I would recommend this product for lemonade lovers above any others though. It is tangy, not syrupy sweet. Yum.",

            "This blue corn masa (flour) is exceptional. I bought it to use in a variety of ways: cornbread, stuffing, tortillas and recently, I made gorditas with it.  I'm gluten free so using corn as a grain is nice from time to time.  The blue corn variety is deeper and much richer in taste than it's yellow counterpart. I prefer the richness it has when combined with other food. However, if I was just making cornbread for example (which is all about the corn and nothing much combined in it) I'd probably go for the yellow flour which is less intense. Making corn tortillas from the blue corn and stuffing the tortillas with ground beef, salsa, etc...is a much better experience with the blue corn; it adds an intensity to the whole taste. I love it. I'd like to try making tamales using the blue corn masa. I'll report back.",

            "I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least  gluten-free  like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good  bite  to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item. For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.",

Both boxes of Jolly Ranchers had one broken candy after another.  I just threw away about ten of them because they are not just broken, but crushed to dust.

Then expand the horizons by searching all the wonderful online recipes. Winter is coming; it's time to enhance those savory stews and one-pot dishes --- to take the plain to the extraordinary.<br /><br />I personally like this French gray salt and herb combination because I don't like to overdo it with the herbs. I prefer a more subtle flavor. However, if you prefer more herbal punch, you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone, or make your own mix, which is quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will be fighting with the salt.<br /><br />If you need to watch your sodium intake, you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt --- and the crystals are very large, so it is easy to over salt your dish. You will be fine, if you make adjustments for salt required for your particular recipe. This is just something to consider, when ordering this combo product.<br /><br />I can attest to the freshness of this product.  Upon opening the glass jar, the fragrance was very potent and lovely. I also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twist-on-lid.  This will help maintain freshness.<br /><br />All said, I highly recommend this product, with the reservations mentioned. These concerns are manageable. Just remember that this product is predominately salt, with herbs as the secondary enhancement, but the herbs won't go unnoticed.",

            "Since Frisky no longer makes those great little round balls of Dental Diet cat food, I had to go looking for something else. Science Diet seemed to be the only likley alternative. My cats liked the different size and texture of the round balls but in their infinite wisdom Frisky (the nitwits) decided there wasn't a market for the product any longer. Fat lot they know. Our three cats don't love this  dental diet cat food  as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats.",
            "This product lists equivalency in drops, yet the packaging is not a dropper style bottle nor does it have any type of dropper applicator. The equivalency is also very wrong, it is not nearly as sweet as it labels itself to be. It also has a bitter after-taste that I have not had with other sucralose based liquid sweeteners.",
            "My cat loves this food, must be the gravy. He likes all of the indoor canned foods that have the rice and greens.  Shipping was very quick and the price on Amazon was good",
            "I love this salt. It imparts an intense smoke and salt seasoning flavor to whatever you are putting it on. I paid 10 dollars for the three tins and found it to be pricey but worthy and unique. I don't think I would pay 15 dollars for it though unless you think it critical for a recipe. I smoke my own foods but I would not smoke with this salt on anything. If you grill on a gas barbeque then this may help you achieve smoky flavor and saltiness at the same time. It is good for other foods cooked indoors as well. Again if you barbeque with wood then you might not need this at all. I recommend using this on fish. I also suggest you have a salt grinder as the granules are to the larger size type of salt crystal and reducing it in size helps to avoid heavily salted spots and spread out the flavor evenly.",
            "Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say  man I can sure go for some raman , but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.",

I found Mrs. Wages at a local Mennonite market and figured I would give it a try. I'm so happy I did. I found the  Hot  salsa to be plenty spicy for my palate. I think it will definitely be too spicy for my son... maybe not my daughter. I did add one small chili pepper (which it probably didn't need), a chopped onion, and a bit of fresh cilantro. I don't think it needed any of these extra ingredients, but it does taste great if you have them on hand.",
            "...Do I really want TWELVE packs of these things?<br /><br />They are delicious from the start, a temptress of taste buds calling in a delicate tickle of caramel sweet despite a dry rice cracker texture.

Uncle Rays is a brand I've seen around there frequently. Since this is such a hard to find product I expected to pay big bucks to buy it online.

He doesn't leave this one so he likes it somewhat. It's ground, so that isn't his favorite but you can actually see vegetables in this one. I like that part so that's why I buy it.",

            "If you're an instant-ramen connoisseur, this is the noodle you've been searching for. Bowl Noodle is far better than any other instant noodle I've had. The broth is cloudy, rich, and immensely flavorful compared to any soup, not just other instants, but surprisingly light on the tongue and stomach... much unlike the, heavy, bland dollar-a-dozen cardboard noodle. (To emphasize the difference: Top Ramen and Ichiban actually make me throw up now, just because they're too bland and... cardboard... -esque... I can stomach Maruchan if I fill it with my entire spice cabinet.) Bowl Noodle has the same punch as Campbell Hearty when it comes to taste. Two of them fill me perfectly if I'm in desperate hunger. I'll have one for a snack instead of chips because it's a lot quicker and more satisfying. I recommend these to all my ramen-eating friends and they love them to death, but they're around 5-10x more expensive than Maruchan. Every penny is worth it, though. To those who buy: you're in for a treat. Enjoy!",

I bought this for myself as retail therapy and I'm satisfied with it. I wish the chocolate flavor came through a bit more but it's better than not tasting it at all (like at Starbucks when the drink is so bitter). Mochas are my drink of choice and I'm glad I tried this brand. The price was right as well.",

Add 1/4 cup of frozen yellow corn with the mix for even more color.

It's the papad that my mother bought in India, and it's the one that I buy in New York. We're trying to watch our weight, so these are a much tastier, lower fat, higher nutrition, version of potato crisps that you see in the stores all the time.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer, I have a tough time sharing these, so the 20 pack isn't unreasonable for me. Think about it: you have a snack that's ready in seconds, and can be eaten with pickles, with chutneys, with meals, or all by itself. AND it's not dripping with fat. I have a lot of friends over, so I tend to run through papad fairly quickly.",

I used to think I was an oatmeal snob for ignoring 'instant' in favor of 'old-fashioned,' but steel-cut is an even larger step-up. Every brand of steel-cut I've tried has benefited from a nuttier, chewier flavor and texture.

So if this is what you are looking for then you are in luck, but if you are instead looking for a hazelnut flavored chocolate coating a coffee bean, as I was look elsewhere.<br /><br />These do taste like a chocolate coated piece of coffee flavored candy, but not what I was desiring nor expecting when I placed my order for this item.  Instead they are shaped and formed to give one they are in fact a real coffee bean, which they are not.",

            "While walking the aisles of Wegmans yesterday I came across this product, and after reading the back I though,  hey, this sounds kind of good!   When I got back I tried it instantly on a multigrain craker and all I could think was WOW!  The spread is a little sweet, a little spicy, a little savory, and could honestly go with just about anything.  I can even imagine using this as an addition to my chicken marinade, or on top of baked salmon.  The possibilities truly are endless, and the best part is that this product is actually healthy.  So if you have the chance to buy this, you really have to give it a try - you will NOT regret it!",

            "Coffee-like drink without the caffeine - wonderful!<br /><br />For years I have tried to cut back on coffee by avoiding it (not a good idea) switching to tea (ok but still does not work for me), or substituting other things (usually too rich and fattening). But now, I have experienced Teeccino, and I love it.<br /><br />All coffee drinkers will know what I mean when I say there is a different feeling and mental/psychological experience between drinking a cup of rich, dark coffee and a cup of wonderful tea. Both are great, but if you really want coffee, the tea just does not have the same look or texture/feel in the mouth like coffee has.<br /><br />So Teeccino is a great substitute for coffee because it meets these qualities I look for. It is dark, sometimes black, in the cup. It is rich smelling, and has the body or texture in the mouth like a coffee product. Just like coffee and tea, you can drink it plain or add cream and sugar.<br /><br />This particular blend with the chocolate is wonderful. I, personally, do not add any sugar at all, but I do use a little creamer sometimes.<br /><br />I like a cup of Teecinno in the late afternoon and evening because it is herbal and has absolutely NO caffeine. I can have my coffee-like drink without the worry of being up all night long. We all know that even de-caffinated drinks still have caffeine and therefore can still cause problems for some people, but this never had caffeine so there are no problems.<br /><br />Finally, I tried other brands of a similar product, but I promise you, Teeccino is the best of all of them, and it has multiple flavors to match the specialty coffees on the market.",

            "I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.",

But they obtained my phone number from Amazon, called me to tell me that normally they overnight these types of items in any event, but while they would happily upgrade for Saturday Delivery at no charge to me so I would have the order for Christmas, they had worries that there was possibly no Saturday delivery in rural area (I live in Bridgehampton NY and they were correct, there is no Saturday deliver here even from Fed-X) and so, to avoid the order sitting around unrefrigerated from Friday till Tuesday, they were calling to ask if they should hold the order and instead ship Tuesday for Wednesday.<br /><br />Since I did not pick up my calls Thursday eve or Friday AM rather than just leave a voice-mail a call their job done, when I finally answered a call at 5:20 Friday, it was from a seller employee's cell phone, who had my order with him, in order to be able keep it freshest, pending an instruction from me, and so as to make absolutely sure they were following my wishes.<br /><br />As you can imagine the items received were commensurate with that service, and when they arrived Wednesday morning they were perfect IN EVERY WAY.<br /><br />And no matter how expensive the items (and they were the cheapest of their kind I found this season), this kind of service, while certainly also rare as the items themselves, is in my estimation, priceless.",

Initially we tried the cheapy route with a few off the shelf grocery store dog foods; with those he wouldn't eat for a day or two before getting too hungry to avoid it.  Then we went with Blue Buffalo Wliderness, because of positive reviews and a recommendation from a dog trainer.  He mostly liked it, except for the dark black bits (I think the antioxidants in the food.  They kind of looked like dried blueberries.  So he would pick through his food, spitting those out on the floor and making a mess.<br /><br />This dog food he really likes.  So much so that we actually have to pay attention to how much he eats; the other foods he has tried we could just fill up the bowl every so often and he ate whenever.<br /><br />We are on our second bag of food (8 weeks into feeding Go!)

Its a nice blend and tastes very rich.

It's sweet, light, and perfect for sprinkling without fear of overkill. This salt tastes like regular $5 salt to me. I'd send it back if it wouldn't cost nearly as much to ship it, but trust me when I tell you the Victoria brand is unlike anything you've ever tasted. I read the backs of both jars and this one is harvested from the whole island, where the Victoria brand is harvested from the one coast.

I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!",

Firehouse just wasn't the same without it, honestly. It's pretty hot. I haven't been there for a while, but they rate their hot sauces there on a 1-10 scale, and I'm rather certain this is rated with an 8. It's warm. If Tabasco or Tapatio is too hot for you, you might find this to be a bit ridiculous. If on the other hand, you could bathe your food in those sauces, you'll be fine with this. It's hot but there is definitely hotter stuff out there. A lot of sauces seem to focus on the heat and not the flavor, but that's not really the case here. This stuff actually has a really nice flavor to it. Flavor's pretty subjective, and to be frank, I'm not sure I can effectively describe the flavor. Get one bottle, or try it out if you've got a hot sauce store or a Firehouse Subs around... It's my go to sauce if I'm looking for something that packs a punch. For me, I don't really need anything hotter, and it's hot enough that I still hang onto a couple other milder sauces for days when I'm not feeling quite so frisky.",

I was aching for a taste of my hometown, so I went as far as hunting them down online, since I didn't remember the name.

This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants.

Please call 1-800-242-8807 between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, Monday through Friday, to speak with a China Mist representative. (If you call at any other time, you may leave a message and we'll return the call.) We will cheerfully replace the product or return your money, whichever you prefer.  <br /><br />This tea has a super strong after taste, unlike all the other teas which I absolutely love to drink.",
            "This truffle oil is tasty - and affordable.  We've used it in mushroom risotto and numerous other recipes with great results.  If you want a strong truffle flavor this wouldn't be the product for you, but if you love the mild flavor of truffles, go for it!",

Nope. No expiration dates. For all I know, these could already be expired. I tried calling the manufacturer, and I just get a phone tree. When I click the only option that might be reasonable (sales), the response is  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your selection. Please enter that number again.  When you do this three times, Portion Pac Inc. hangs up.",

One other negative for me is the amount of sugar/carbs in this jerky.  It isn't overly sweet, but if you are low carbing a bag of this can throw you off track!",

I figured they wouldn't be as good as dark chocolate since i prefer dark but thought they would still be tasty. The package I received was dented and the chocolate bars were melted. It makes it hard to open since each bar is bent and chocolate is stuck to packaging. The bars themselves taste a little stale. Needless to say this purchase was a big disappointment as I love coconut and chocolate.",

To me, they taste just fine, and an unsalted, untoasted sunflower seed is, well, expected maybe to be somewhat bland, perhaps?  A seed with a little crunch is fine by me, and we'll buy these in bulk again if the price is right since finding shelled, unsalted seeds (which is what we want) locally is impossible.",
            "I love strawberries.  These berries you can have all year round and there is never a bad one.  The price is cheap compared to what I can find in a store.  I use them for just munching, on top of ice cream, or in yogurt.  They taste like strawberries, but are crunchy.",

I would have thought it was just time, or my imagination playing tricks on me, but he agreed, the gum tasted chemically and had a terrible consistency. We both spit it out after a few chews. I don't know if they changed something in the mix, or if it's just indicative of the low quality and corner cutting society we now live in, but I would definitely not recommend this gum...nostalgia factor is fun, but the flavor is not!",

Then she giggled and said,  Mama - that yucky  and proceeded to wipe her napkin on her tongue.<br /><br />I love most of the Happy Baby and Happy Tot products, but I guess this was a no go.<br /><br />If you are wondering, the meal is actually very soupy and has all of the ingredients chopped up quite small and is mixed up like a stew.  You cook it 30 seconds in the microwave and then eat.  It couldn't be self fed with fingers.<br /><br />Hope that review helps!",
            "I'll only get  a Vente Pikes Place Roast if it's all Starbucks has and I'll never every buy the beans at the store. To me it lacks a full flavor and characteristically has a bitter/acidic after taste. Because I dislike Pike's Place roast so much I bought a french press and bought some original House blend. To my horror, House now tastes very similar to Pike's Place. I'm going to retry the Italian blend next.<br /><br />I will give credit though where credit is due. If Starbucks roasts and brews Pike's Place like they're supposed to the coffee tastes OKish. But often times, I either get burnt tasting coffee, acidic tasting coffee, or coffee that has a lingering aftertaste of soap suds.<br /><br />Let me just leave you with a qoute from the House Blend package before the quote disappears as the flavor has:<br /><br /> When we opened our first store in Seattle's Pike's Place Market, we wanted a House Blend that captured the signature expression of our roasting style--glistening, dark chestnut beans loaded with flavor. Years later, it's still why people come through our doors <br /><br />Question Starbucks,<br /><br />1.> If House is still your signature expression of your roasting style, why'd you leave it behind?<br />2.> If House is why people walk through your doors, why are you serving Pike's Place?",

The down side is and has nothing to do with the product is they are approximately $22.00 higher here then other websites selling them on the net. Google and see for yourself. To add insult to injury the Vendor is going to make you wait for a three four day processing before they ship them to you. DUH! I have Amazon Prime and love it and buy most items here but this is one I took a pass on as the seller is selling at an awful hefty price in comparison to other vendors. I found them elsewhere for $27.00 a case! Shame on you Liquid Nation you will never get any of my business. I RATED THIS PRODUCT A TWO STAR ONLY BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE VALUE AND DISGUSTINGLY OBSCENE COST! As far as the product itself goes it's a five star.",

These tubes work out roughly the same price per gram as buying the small jars locally. The free shipping and convenience of delivery made this a good deal. A lot less waste using the tubes, and no more scraping a knife around the inside of a jar.<br />They actually shipped direct from the UK, so question about whether this was going to be some different version made specifically for the US palette.<br />I ordered 10 of these, and the expiration date was a little under 8 years, I do not expect they will last more than 8 weeks.",

Great value!!! ~Ruby~",
            "Aside from the fact that sesame oil is absolutely the most divine tasting oil, I have to hand it to this product. It tastes pretty fresh and has a rich nutty sesame oil taste and the texture is a teeny bit thick and wonderful. I like that it is organic and it is only medium refined which hopefully makes you think less chemicals were used in the refining process. I do wish they would give you more details about the refining process, storage history, freshness and any chemicals used in their oil. I think you are partially guessing here. Unrefined sesame oil is divine and tastes a little richer and more  meaty  than highly refined. To me it is kind of like the difference between whole wheat bread and white bread (though not so striking). Unrefined does not seem as smooth-tasting as a refined oil, and may have more of a distinct taste in recipes, whereas the refined sesame oil is more subtle and may blend in better with your other ingredients. However, I love this oil and if you want the sesame aspect to be the  star  of your dish this oil will add a lot.",

Since he is a shih tzu he also throws up from time to time after eating. (Do all shih tzus do this, mine has since birth) Anyway, this food seems to cut down on the incidents.

We prefer the flavor of the 'hot' variations even though the flavor isn't really hot...it's kinda sweet with a tang (but not overly sweet like a brown sugar or honey bbq sauce).<br /><br />The thicker style is nice to get a good bbq sear on the grill.  The normal sauce is very thin and is basically great as a dip, marinade or mix-in.  But this thicker style can definitely stand on it's own!",

It is so delicious, I often don't even use olive oil on my salad, although Stonehouse's Estate Blend Olive Oil is a delicious pairing. It also tastes excellent on vanilla ice cream.",
            "I purchased these at a big-box petstore locally and I was rather miffed to discover that these are not what they appear. I expected bull pizzles, but it seems all of the  Red Barn  brand Chew-A-Bulls are reconstituted and not real pizzles. They have gone to great lengths to make the product look like a real bull pizzle, but they are not the real thing and do not last like the real thing. I knew something was wrong when my dog had devoured it within minutes. Close inspection revealed flashing from the mold used to form them and the ends were smooth and uniform, unlike a real pizzle.<br />Bull pizzles aren't particularly cheap, and neither are the cheap imitations like these.<br />I truly felt like I had been deliberately deceived, enough so to warn others.",
            "Very soothing flavor. I know they say,  ...feels like a dentist cleaning after chewing it...  but this one is the closest to making that statement true.  I usually don't leave comments on seemingly trivial items but this gum was good enough to take the time and recommend.",
            "These are so pretty and the subtle plum flavor coupled with the toasty nuttiness of the sesame seeds gives the culinary curiosity seeker some taste-bud adventure as well as a unique visual display.<br /><br />This year [2011] I plan on making a non-traditional Christmas dinner with 5 different kinds of Sushi and I can't wait to use these for my Sushi. I'm going to buy the green Wasabi sesame seeds by Roland next month so that I can do a cute red and green inside-out Sushi. Maybe I'll even take a picture and upload it to Amazon.com if it turns out well.<br /><br />The bottles are convenient in size and I like the little twist-off lids for shaking the seeds on your choice of food. I like to shake some of these on my stir-fries and soups after plating. If you stir these into something during cooking, their pretty color WILL wear off, so they are best used after cooking rather than during.<br /><br />Note: These plum sesame seeds are NOT vegan. These contain 'carmine' which comes from beetles for the red coloring.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients listed on my bottles:<br /><br />Sesame Seeds, Seasonings, Salt, Citric Acid, Natural Plum Powder, Carmine, Spices, Sugar.<br /><br />These are a product of Taiwan.",

This is a great coloring and flavoring for rice, cookies, cakes and a little on poultry. It would be a waste to use it as tea. I normally crush it and add to hot water to get the maximum fragrance and flovor. Look up recipes to use Saffron in food. Bon Apetit!!",

Almost a dozen later, That I ate :o( but they were worth it ) I felt, I may not want to share these wonderful delghtful tresures. Luckily for me, I bought 2 bags and one was a little damaged, so I contacted the C/S and they sent me another 2 bags.

The only thing I wish they had about this product is if they sold it a bigger quantity. My dog goes through these bones like water. But its worth it. It keeps him from getting into other things.

The mint flavor is much stronger than the ordinary peppermint tea that I buy in the supermarket.<br /><br />However this is not peppermint tea, but a combination of mint flavors. The result is amazing.<br /><br />The coffee shop served a huge 16 oz cup of tea.

I'm already a big fan of this company, and their other salts, so knew I was off to a good start when I found this.  It is VERY good.  The truffle flavor is there (sort of an 'umami' quality), but not overbearing.  I can use the right amount of salt for my taste, and get  enough  truffle flavor to notice it.

After doing a little research I've found that this is a good quality dog food.  And it's specifically engineered for German Shepherds which have notoriously sensitive stomachs. I've tried other foods and with this one my dogs coat looks a lot healthier and he has more energy. It also lasts longer than a #40 bag of the cheap dog food since he doesn't have to eat as much to get full. I used to get this food at Petsmart but I have to drive 40 min either east or west from where I live to get to a Petsmart so I found it to be incredibly convenient to be able to order on Amazon. I still buy it at Petsmart but I don't have to make special trip just for dog food anymore. And with Amazon Prime I can get it shipped for free and it only cost about $3 more than at Petsmart but it cost more than that in gas to drive there. I've bought this here several times and will continue to buy it here since it's so convenient.",

            "I have a hard time believing Benriach 15 Dark Rum cask finished single malt whiskey is really aged 15 years. It's tow-headed pale yellow: among the lightest colored whiskey's I've ever seen. The aroma is nice - marshmallow, cake batter and butterscotch. With extended time a clear pineapple note comes to dominate the aroma. The pineapple and butterscotch aroma (pineapple upside down cake?) is yummy. On the tongue it is filigreed and lacy. Cerial honey, cake batter up front. There are some fruit esters at midpalate (apricot and sugar cane) and distant wood notes at the finish which is moderately short. My issue here is that there is too little oomph. What flavor there is here is nice - but there's a bit too little for my taste. Looking, smelling, and drinking this I would guess it has 8 years in the wood - not 15.",

Yunnan Gold is sweet with a slight peppery feel that can be drunk anytime.  (Avoid at night if you're sensitive to caffeine).  It is a complex tea that you will be turning to time and again.

I love the taste and just when I think I will have to indulge in a second one (knowing that would be soooo wrong) I finish it and feel completely satisfied and relieved to be so.

            "What can a person say about a dog treat. They are all the same, right? Wrong. I have tried so many treats on the market that I can't remember half of them any longer. I like the Old Mother Hubbard Meaties treats for dogs...chicken flavor. First of all the size is perfect to use in training your dog. So many of the training treats out there are just too small or too large. These treats are the perfect size. I usually get the chicken flavor but with the extra chicken added. It comes in Lamb and Liver flavor too. When I yell to my dogs that I have a 'special treat for you' they come running, which is what I want. They even know where I keep it and poke it with their noses while they wait impatiently for me to open the bag. I make them sit before I give it to them. They love the flavor of the extra chicken treats and never turn it down. I like it because of the size and my use in training with the dogs. I usually buy them 10 bags at a time because I go through them so fast. It's one of my favorite things to reach for with the dogs. The price has continued to go up on this product but so has it for other dog treats as well. I also like the fact that Old Mother Hubbard uses only a good quality of things in their products.",

These things are packaged as  gourmet,  are from a small company that made me believe it was some small but caring mom-and-pop company, and who doesn't love flan?  I can't see how these are gourmet considering how bad they taste, maybe the company is caring but the cookies don't taste like it, and the best things about flan are the texture and the decadent sweet fatty taste.  You don't get any of it with this.<br /><br />These cookies taste like there's too much flour.  They're like butter cookies where someone took out 1/2 the sugar and put in too much flour.  It's got a pasty texture and the taste doesn't compare to real flan.  The closest comparison I can give is they taste like bad shortbread. If figure if something is going to be close to flan in cookie-form, it's got to be real flan put into some type of pastry to keep it from falling apart.  These cookies are just pasty and dry.",
            "This is delicious tea.  I have purchased it in the past for myself and as a gift for someone who says it is her favorite tea.<br /><br />That said the seller I tried to purchase from, ARRAM Traders, is a bit strange.  I placed an order, but the order remained listed as  shipping soon  with a wide range on the estimated arrival date. Since my purchase included a gift, I wasn't sure if shipment would arrive in time so I emailed ARRAM Traders and said I wanted to cancel and told them why. (I thought I would go online and try to track down another source.)<br /><br />Shipper contacted me saying they had already shipped. I replied that I had only cancelled<br />because shipping was vague, and so was happy that it might arrive soon afterall. Asked, if they had any estimate of arrival time. Afterall, UK delivers to US all the time and they should have some I idea based on previous deliveries to the States.<br /><br />ARRAM Traders said they couldn't tell me anything about a delivery estimate and chose to cancel the order.  Very strange.  I suspect that they were out of stock, had not actually shipped the tea at all and were not sure when they would ship, if ever.  Otherwise, they should have been able to tell me when they shipped and, based on other shipments made to US, estimate delivery (a week, two weeks....whatever).<br /><br />So if you like a brightly flavored tea and can find it, I recommend this one highly.  It really tastes like pineapple and grapefruit and is delicious hot or cold.<br /><br />And, please, if you find another source, please let me know.<br /><br />FOUND A NEW SOURCE: BritishMart and look forward to receiving this tea.",

I even tried mixing it with cooked meat and still no go.<br /><br /> I love the idea of it (though there seemed to be very little actual meat in it) but if the dogs won't eat it, all the money and good intentions in the world mean nothing.

Not crazy about the  >$1  price per package ... but if you don't have access to one of the few stores which sell the Chiclets packages right now, this Amazon price will do.  (Fancy brands in grocery stores are $3.50, where these are $1.00.)  (So far, I find at Dollar Tree, and Big Lots.) I had hoped for more flavors among the return of Chiclets; but it seems only the two... Fruit and the Peppermint.  I confess I'd not remembered the gum lately.  But, when the new (expensive!) plastic tubs of gum in loose pieces became popular -- it reminded me of Chiclets.<br /><br />The cross-section population who comes and goes at my office via the Delivery Door where I sit, has chosen its favorite-- CHICLETS, FRUIT Flavor, even more-often than the intense mint options.  I'm thankful, as it saves me a lot of money while I keep all manner of visitors happy.   I'm doing some things right:  the gum helps to keep our office on the good-list with every brand of couriers!   I deposit the chiclets into one of those tubs for distribution.  Each gum is not individually wrapped (like are my other favorite, Life Savers) but the  pour  method for the gum, still helps to reduce the degree of germ-sharing.",

I sometimes have this soup on its own but I especially like it with pasta and it's a cinch to make. My favorite easy-easy-easy recipe is to take a can of the soup, add 1/4 to 1/2 a can of water (optional -- as  sauce  it's thicker without the water of course), cook it on the stovetop, pour half of it over cooked pasta or egg noodles (the standard 2 oz. UNCOOKED weight per serving), and mix well. Put in a medium square Ziploc container, snap on the lid, and freeze. (So the way I do it, I get 2 servings per can of soup.)  I usually have several of these in my freezer so if I am lazy I just grab one to take to work with me -- it heats up in the microwave in 2-3 minutes.  It makes a pretty filling lunch that is low in calories, very low in fat (maybe 2 or 3 grams per serving including the egg noodles), and quite tasty!

The sauce for these beans works well with all of the above.  I grew up, in the days before ramen, considering a small can of baked beans heated with sliced radishes mixed in, to be an excellent budget dinner.

I was very disappointed when upon seeing the pictures I saw that everything that was detailed on the item page as being included was not.<br /><br />Item was not as described and I contacted Amazon and the rep  Taniya  initially just gave me her opinion on the matter instead of a real answer to my question. I asked if I had to call the company directly to just have the missing items sent. At no point did I ask for a replacement or a refund, just wanted the missing advertised items. After I expressed my dissatisfaction of her reply (her opinion) to my question a refund was offered only if I placed the order again. This did not resolve my problem at all.

You can easily buy all this yourself for $15 or less. Lesson learned.",

So I figure maybe i am steeping it too long....or squeezing out the water from the leaves too much and thus getting the orange oil....and if i dilute with water...then the tea just tastes bland....so i don't think the problem is that it's too strong.<br /><br />At any rate, I make sure to have this tea on hand and drink two cups just about every day!<br />Thank you, Market Spice for offering it in Green tea....which tastes sweeter then the regular black tea Market Spice.",

            "This coffee gives off great crema and a robust aroma when brewing, but I found the taste the most bitter I've yet had in all the espressos I have bought lately to try out.  It's quite potable with lots of milk and vanilla flavorings, though...but nowhere near as good as my Lavazza.  The bitterness overrides any flavor this coffee may have.  I certainly didn't taste any, and the bitterness lingered in my mouth long after my coffee was done.",

The coffee cuts some of the sweetness which could overwhelm the spread but doesn't thanks to the coffee, plus, what is better than coffee and chocolate? This is so good I literally could not stop eating it. Try it, you will be amazed, and I love Nutella and the cookie spreads but delicious as the cookie spreads are, they are a tad sickening after a few bites; this is not, it is a perfect blend of coffee and chocolate.

They contain a variety of fillings, probably not everything Koppers makes, but a nice sampling (dried fruit, cordials, nuts, hard candy). Also be aware, they do not all have chocolate inside; some are candy coating all the way down to the filling. Better be VERY confident in your dental work before you bite! This is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Actually kind of fun...not knowing what's inside. A nice introduction to Koppers products.",

            "The other review on this is harsh and incorrect.  This honey is really great, I've bought it twice.  What the other reviewer fails to mention is that in the US the regulations are different and UMF if not a designation recognized by the FDA so it is not required on the packaging. You usually find it on bottles actually imported from New Zealand so if you really want to pay extra for that then go for it. However to call someone a fraud when their company has been in business for so long is rude. If you don't like the honey well then...don't buy it.<br /><br />Their customer service has been great, the only issue I had is that one of the glass bottles I purchased broke in the mail and I left a message which was promptly responded to and a replacement bottle was sent right away with many sincere apologies. I have more trust in a company that has been around for so long and has great Amazon reviews over someone who is adamant about designations, but relies on his sense of 'taste' to evaluate what he is complaining the company isn't evaluating scientifically.<br /><br />This honey is great tasting and worth it!",

Plus it tasts REALLY bad (I've been mixing it with Muscle Milk to cover the taste because I'm too cheap to just throw it away), it's extremely grainy (kinda coats your throat going down making it super gaggy) and sometimes all the protein in it dumps out and coagulates into a nasty ball inside the shake ball in my shaker-cup if I don't drink it fast enough...I've eaten some pretty horrible stuff (mostly on dares) and I can't handle a Universal only protein shake...too nasty. I'm sticking souly to Muscle Milk and Optimum Nutrition brand protein powders...lower cholesterol (Muscle Milk is only 5% per serving) and MUCH better taste.",

            "I just bought my first box of this, being a sort of STASH CHAI addict, drinking the BLACK CHIA TEA, and the GREEN CHIA TEA, both of which are good. So, you like CHAI? great. The box lists the same spices for each box, but they are in different ratios, depending on the strenght of the backround tea. The black tea, uses ginger, then cinnamon, clove, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamon, in decreasing amounts of spice, as you decend down the spice list. (altho the company also uses spice oils, for the teas, for more flavor.) The green tea CHIA as more cinnamon in it, compaired to the black chia. NOW, for the WHITE CHIA. SPICES AS  FOLLOWS, its mostly CINNAMON, then ginger, allspice, clove, nutmeg, and cardamon. ALL real CHIA teas, use these spices, but they need to be balanced to the teas, and WHITE TEA, is very delicate tea, of course. ALso, since it is even less processed than GREEN TEA, its very easy to make it bitter.  (It has more antioxidants than green tea too.) SO, if you get this, and you want it to taste good, dont throw BOILING WATER on the tea bag(s). Let your water sit for a minute, until its around 190 degrees F. THEN, add your tea bags, and dont let it brew for more than FOUR MINUTES. THEN, like ALL CHIA TEA, it must be VERY sweet, for the spices to  work . I add asparteme, and LOTS of it ,and a bit of honey, and some SOY MILK....ALL DONE!!! Stash's chia tea is the best, the VERY BEST. I tasted them all. There's no black pepper, chicory, or other wierdness.  SO, even tho with white chia you only get 18 bags of tea per box, instead of 20 with the GREEN or BLACK CHIA, its worth the few extra pennies for this tea. BUT, first, do you like WHITE TEA, and DO YOU LIKE SPICES? (and if you dont like to sweeten your tea, or add milk/soy, just stay away from CHIA. ) PS. dont make this the old TIBETIAN way, cos you dont want to BOIL white tea.",

The bamboo shoots have an interesting texture but they are tasteless.  They derive taste from the curry.  For baby corns, you have to fish for them.  I counted five to six pieces of fragments, each for � inch to 3/8 inch long.  They have the texture of dried wood.  The can was labeled 15.4-oz net weight; I estimate that more than 2/3 of it is the watery curry.  It is mildly sweet from the coconut milk and has a pleasant curry favor.

The first cup I made was a bit  earthy  for my taste but since I am dieting and I wanted something affordable enough to make at least 3 cups a day. I did some research.I found that some recommended improving the flavor with  waking up  the leaves by pouring a small bit of hot water on them and then draining it off and adding fresh water for steeping. I also read that Oprah likes to spice hers up with a mix of cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Wow both those tips really made all the difference for me. I love this tea made that way and I love the price. I may try a small amount of a more expensive brand just to compare but for the price this combo is going to be hard to beat.",

            "I bought a box of these on another website. They were much larger than I expected, some pieces were much thinner than others. My dog got through most of the ranger rib within 30 minutes. She is still chewing on some of the pieces that have splintered off.<br /><br />The only worry I have is that the splintered pieces are just that. Thin, sharp, oddly shaped pieces. Even the main bulk of the bone after having split was very sharp looking. I would suggest to monitor your dog, especially if you have one that is known to not chew their food very well, or will get in a rush in the presence of another dog and swallow pieces before being well chewed. Swallowing these sharp pieces could be very dangerous and has me monitoring my dog very closely when she chews on these ranger ribs.<br /><br />I previously bought the Merrick GI bones. The bone is much thicker and does not splinter. One bone for her has lasted her (collie/hound mix) for more than a month and she has barely cracked the bone. Other breeds, her roommate the american bulldog/lab mix makes it look easier to crack the GI bone, but she practically devours the ranger rib very quickly.<br /><br />I would consider buying the ranger ribs only on a treat basis. MAYBE once a week if at that. They get eaten up way too fast. Although they are much cheaper than the GI bones, I don't believe they are worth buying if you want a bone that will last.",

The flavor is anything but weak and they make you want to go back for more.

I was sure I misread it and was about to pay for it, but gluten free or not, it's seriously delicious. My family (non-celiacs) loved it too. It's so moist and already has the carrots and raisins in the mix, it takes no more than 10 min to get it in the oven. I highly recommend using their cream cheese icing recipe (on the box.)<br />I don't write reviews very often, but this cake it THAT good!!",

            "The Dagoba Cacao powder is NOT chocolate coco powder.  In order to turn cacao seeds (the Dagoba powder) into chocolate you must use a long process of drying the beans, roasting the beans, squashing the beans to get the cocoa butter (by the way, the cocoa butter is the  chocolate  we know), use the butter to mix with sugar and other stuff, and finally, re-roast with the blended mixture of cocoa butter and sugar/etc.  The actual bean was tossed out of the process way back when we got the cocoa butter out of it.  This particular product, Dagoba Cacao powder, is the bean, not the cocoa butter.... hence, it is not chocolate.  Why would anyone in their right mind buy this non-chocolate rip off?  This is why:  the cacao bean is extremely healthy and possess many pharmacological benefits for the mind and other parts of the body.  This powder should be used in a smoothie much the same way ginseng, Vit C, ginkgo biloba, etc. is used.  I hoped this helps!!!",

There is just a little fat in the regular version. I can't really discern a difference in taste between the two, and the small amount of fat in the regular version hardly seems of consequence.<br /><br />Either way, a serving is less than 100 calories and has an acceptable amount of protein.",

            "I don't really like to write negative reviews, but I rely upon the reviews of others when I'm assessing items for purchase, so here's a summary of my experience with this product. While the flavor of this oil is okay (not nearly as great as I would have hoped based upon some of the Melina's reviews), the excruciatingly difficult and nonsensical packaging is enough to keep me from ever buying this again. Each individual bottle is quite small and then the narrow neck is covered with some kind of wax or foil cover that has no easy means of getting in--and as the top portion is so narrow that the only way to do it was to cut into it with a sharp blade, it would have been easy to cut myself. I finally was able to cut off tiny bits of the overwrap (which seemed to be a bit sick possibly with some minor oil leakage--perhaps from one of the other bottles) after about 10 minutes only to be confronted with a teeny, tiny cork jammed well into a narrow neck of the bottle with no gripper area or way to get the cork out. I tried two different wine openers with one almost pushing the cork all the way in... I was able to salvage it but then the cork was damaged so that attempting to close the oil bottle in any fashion that would preserve the rest of the oil is now impossible. I'm going to need to decant it into something else to keep it protected. The flavor--after the battle to get into the package was over, I'd have to say the flavor was good but certainly not outstanding. The battle wasn't really worth it--especially for the price.",

Worse, I can even order the mixes on Amazon now, which eliminates the need to go to the store. Thank goodness each mix only makes 9 brownies, so we don't have brownies hanging around our house for more than a day or two.",
            "As a flavored-martini lover, I recently purchased the Amoretti Sour Apple martini mix, and have to say it's delicious!  It has a sweet/sour taste which is really refreshing, especially when applying a citrus sugar around the rim of the glass first.  The directions on the bottle, however, indicate 2 parts mix to 1 part vodka.  We prefer the recipe of 1 part mix to 1 part vodka, which works out perfectly.  If you like Appletinis, I think you'll love this mix - enjoy!",
            "Cranberry. Cranberry is another one of those flavors that brings out very distinct memories for me. Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house, not for the cranberry sauce (which I loathe), but for the cranberry juice she always had on hand. I loved it! And she'd mix it with a bit of ginger ale for me and oh, I felt so grown up...my first cocktail! Virgin, of course. We lost her the year I started college, so every time I taste anything with cranberry, I think of her. Then growing up, my mom taught me how to make this delicious cranberry-orange bread with fresh cranberries, and that bread is why I always have cranberries in my freezer. I made it for my in-laws the first Christmas after the wedding and now they look forward to it every year. Maybe after I've tried this straight I'll need to try it with some orange juice. But cranberry is a flavor very near and dear to my heart, so I am very much looking forward to trying this one. The health benefits of cranberries aren't such a bad thing either, and since I don't drink juice anymore, this might be a good way for me to get them.<br /><br />This blew my socks off. The scent when the package is opened is a sweet cranberry, not the tart berry I was looking for, but I can't bring myself to complain. I put about a quarter of a teaspoon in a small mug, added about 75-80 C water, some sugar, and frothed it up. Then I added robots (by which I mean ice in the shape of robots) and a touch of cold water to make a beautiful iced tea. I am so far from disappointed it hurts. This is lovely. I didn't expect to like this one nearly as much as I do, but I am in love. I'm definitely seeing the berry in cranberry, but there's also a hint of tartness in the middle of the sip. I am so surprised, I honestly didn't expect to be wowed by this. But I am and I am going to restock on it ASAP. I can't wait to try it blended with some vanilla matcha or some orange juice...yum. I don't have a lot of experience with cranberry outside of the little fruits baked into muffins, but I think I need to branch out and try some new things!",

            "Ortho sells a number of Weed B Gon products, and it took me some searching to find exactly the one I wanted. I wanted one of the versions containing the chemical triclopyr, which is what my state agricultural university extension service recommends for killing wild violets, which for several years had been stubbornly resisting all my organic methods to keep them from taking over my lawn. Since I only had a fairly small area to spray and didn't want to invest in major league spraying equipment if I didn't have to, this version was just what I needed. It's very easy to use. You just attach it to the end of your garden hose, turn on the water (not full blast, just enough to make a nice controllable spray) and spray it on your broadleaf weeds. They absorb the triclopyr through their leaves, it messes them up bad and they die.<br /><br />There was enough in the bottle for me to spray the wild violets that hadn't died after the first application (as the directions and my extension service mentioned, you usually can't get them all the first try.) Actually, I spent twice as much money on the respirator I bought to wear when I was doing my spraying. I strongly recommend you read the directions carefully and follow the safety instructions. You don't want to inhale this stuff or get it in your eyeballs or mouth or on your skin. Triclopyr is SUPPOSED to break down fairly quickly and not leave residual traces--we'll see about that.",

I would say De Mi Pais, an obscure brand I found in a latino grocery store in Brooklyn, is close, but borders on too sweet.<br /><br />I found Azul at my supermarket in a glass bottle (like Orangina) and was addicted. It should be known that the water in this can tastes not as good as in the glass.. less sweet.. but it's still a great enough taste that I don't mind it.",
            "Bought this by mistake thinking I was purchasing Citrusmint, my Orbit all-time favorite. Popped a piece in my mouth and was shocked by a burst of chemical taste, kind of green apple, coconut, pineapple with a bitter aftertaste. Really gross. I can't even give it a one. I lasted literally fifteen seconds before I spit it out. My hubs thinks it smells like household cleaner. Bad experience, especially since I was craving that great refreshing taste of Citrusmint!",
            "I made a quick pot of chili to test this out, and the results were excellent (cubed chuck steak, this chili pepper blend, some ground cumin, finely diced onion and garlic, salt and some tomato sauce).  The heat level, though, is just a bit higher than I expected (definitely hotter than Gebhardts chili powder), but it doesn't burn long.  Definitely good flavor, and a great price.",
            "Nice, large silver bag of chili powder. Bag is not resealable so you will have to be prepared with accomodations for long term storage. This is a great alternative to buying tiny bottles of this stuff at the grocery, especially if you use half of one of those bottles in a big batch of chili like I do.<br /><br />It's a nice blend of seasonings for flavoring chili, but it is not spicy. Of course you can add more cayenne if you need it hotter.",
            "it was really rather awesome popcorn.  it really had a banana flavor which was really sweet.  my only problem was that they really don't sell the amounts that make it worth ordering for this provider.  the variety that is offered is really mind blowing.  if the flavor you choose is sweet, my experience is crazy sweet.",
            "I highly recommend the Pinnacle brand. I buy the Pinnacle chicken and tuna for my four Cats, because it's a Holistic Cat food without the animal by-products and doesn't have all the grain fillers, which is what I was looking for.  I checked the listed ingredients on several brands before I bought the first cans to try, and decided to get three cans of each brand. Pinnacle was the only brand my babies would eat.  They just sniffed at their bowls, then walked away without eating it, which I can't blame them for, considering all the YUCK! stuff in some of them.  I ended up giving the other cans away.  My two Ragdolls go absolutely wild for their Pinnacle everyday, like it has catnip in it.  If I'm late feeding them, they follow me around the house and just beg.  They can hear the can top popping from the other end of the house, too!  It's so funny to watch them and hear the little meows. My two boys just can't wait for me to put it in their bowls...they're gobblin' it faster then I can dish it out.  So, I'll keep on buying it on Amazon (my local pet stores don't stock it).",
            "This is simply the BEST CHAI EVER!  I used to buy it in the stores but once they became unavailable I reached out to Amazon and bingo.  Then I purchased the small cans.  They became unavailable so I switched to the bags.  Please, please, please Amazon, don't stop carrying this item.  This is creamy and warm with just the right spices.",
            "This cereal is a fave at our house. It can be a snack or a cereal. It has a nice appealing texture which does stay crispy with milk longer than flake type or other shredded grain type products. It is sweet but not sugary. We find it very satisfying. Not sure I notice any brown sugar taste - but as noted it is sweeter than plain grain cereal.<br /><br />Oats seem like a heart healthy concept - I'm not entirely sure that the processing of said oats into this cereal makes it healthy but then we alternate it with real oatmeal so it is not a daily meal for us. It does seem to go quickly as it is easy to eat a bigger bowl than the serving so we have to watch that.<br /><br />We also (contrary to the cover) do not like this with fruit unless the fruit is slightly tart. It makes it too sweet. So for those strawberries or other berries that have a more sour than sweet taste this is ideal. For fruits like banana's or sweet blueberries it was just too much sweet for us.",

I let them soak in water overnight, sowed them in some starting seed soil, and they began to germinate rapidly. I think just about all 25 have germinated within a week and a half. I am pleased with this purchase and am excited to watch them grow.",
            "Our older cat (14 years old) would only lick the juice from the bowl and let the chunks alone.  I've read since then that cats are carnivores and therefore should not be fed a grain-based diet.  So many cat foods on the market have grains as the main components, and so you have to look for products labeled  grain free .  We found some at our local feed store.  Maybe our first cat would have lived longer if we'd fed him better.",

And apple sauce, ginger, some vinegar, sugar, spices and, of course, Habanero peppers. No preservatives whatsoever.<br /><br />I don't know why, I expected a super-hot mixture, something likely to burn a hole in my stomach if swallowed but, as it happens to be the case with the other Fischer & Wieser sauce I sampled, the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3Q0QK >Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, 20-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>, this one too is a well-balanced - it means NOT HOT - concoction that discretely but effectively enhances the taste of whatever it may be added to. My uses so far, and the Habanero met and exceeded expectations: an Egyptian omelette (don't ask how or why), lamb chops, salmon.<br /><br />When used as directed, the Habanero sauce will tilt any dinner toward the mysterious, the flavorful, the exotic.<br /><br />P.S. - it's a 5-star ONLY if you don't mind 'sweet' in a hot sauce.",

I can't say its a problem with the product, which arrived quickly, well-packaged and in good condition.  But the plain one she has chewed on for weeks, whereas she showed no interest in these.  Fortunately it wasn't terribly expensive, as I think the remaining hooves are going to the neighbor's dog.",

But her greenie is the only thing she will eat without stopping.  She loves the taste.  They also seem to be easy to eat - soft and chewy - so if your dog has sensitive teeth, this might be a good treat to consider.<br /><br />On top of that, greenies are supposed to help with your dog's dental health, which is great for me, because brushing my dog's teeth is really difficult.",

            "Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0002DGRSY >Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.",

I'm writing to alert the seller and any potential buyers that this price, $7.99 for one packet of four chazuke servings, is ridiculously high.  Is the description wrong, and this is actually more than one packet?  Is the seller really trying to get a 300% markup over regular retail just for selling through Amazon?  If you're thinking of buying Nagatanien ochazuke, you're better off buying the ones sold by Uwajimaya.  Amazon carries these as well, under the  More Buying Choices  box that (for me at least) shows up on the right of the screen.",

I considered that there was a possibility the food may have had a  sliver of bone  or some such contamination and stated this in my review, because my two cats previously liked this food. TURNS OUT that she has an allergy to who knows what (not this product I'm sure) which has made her mouth sore. The vet said it is common even in young cats and suggested it could have been caused by grass or plants she may have eaten during her short little trips out into the yard. So I am recinding my previous poor review and suggest that you buy this product if your cat likes it.

            "While I enjoyed the contents of this basket, I must admit that the current price of almost $60 seems a bit steep to me.  The basket contains quite literally  a taste  of some of the items as some of the items only contain two or three pieces.  For instance, there are only two chocolate covered cherries and only three hazelnut chocolates.  There is a single brewing of coffee that comes in a box that is four times the size of the actual bag of coffee contained therein.  There is a tiny box of coffee cookies that contained four very small cookies.  And there is a box of Dolcetto dark chocolate pastry cookies that contain only three tiny sticks.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />There were some items that contained what I consider to be a more  normal  amount.  For instance, there was a pack of Honees candies.  I liked the Honees so much that <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000E7SYKM >I bought a whole case.</a>  There was a box of garlic crackers that I thoroughly enjoyed.  There was a box of olive-oil breadsticks that, at first I thought were just okay, but it turned out that I really liked them.  I also liked the thin water wheel crackers.<br /><br />There is a rosemary herb encrusted salami that is very strong - the jury is still out on that one.<br /><br />I haven't tried the olives or the cheese spread.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the basket, but I can't help but think that it is overpriced for what you are receiving - especially with some of the items being so small.  If the basket was about $35, I would rate it higher.  For $60 you could put together your own basket of goodies that would put this to shame.",

            "Cloud Star's Tricky Trainers are bite-sized, palatable, chewable treats that are approximately 0.5 inches big. They come in three main flavors: cheddar, liver, and salmon. I sampled (well, JP, my dog, sampled) two flavors: cheddar and liver. These treats were perfect sized for putting into a Kong treat dispenser, and were generally palatable (JP finds them much more palatable then dry treats). I found the Tricky Trainers surprisingly more  dry  than most pocket-sized treats, however. In other words, they don't seem to be oily to touch, aren't excessively moist, and have a high anti-squish (i.e., firm) factor. This is beneficial if you're using them as true training treats to reward your dog (i.e., storing them in your pocket). Their con: I found the cheddar smell to be repulsive - it has a really strong smell, so if you're cheese shy, avoid. Cheddar is the 5th ingredient (remember, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance (from most to least). For the other two flavors, chicken liver and salmon are listed first. The other con: the number of calories per treat isn't listed, so we don't know exactly how  low fat  or  low calorie  they truly are. The final con: if you have a super picky puppy that you are trying to train (and are using these as food motivation rewards), these may not work as well as small pieces of hot dog or pieces of freeze-dried liver treats. When it comes to puppy training, finding a treat that your dog can't resist is imperative to get them to train correctly!<br /><br />These products are listed as wheat and corn free, which is good if your dog has these specific food allergies. That said, if your dog doesn't have these specific allergies, not a big deal. The good news: all ingredients are natural, made in the USA, and the products contain no artificial favors or colors. Overall, a pretty good training treat!",

            "These are an extremely smooth dark chocolate truffle that I treat myself to from time to time.  They are also a favorite of friends and friends' children when I let them have a special treat.  The Amazon price is a bit high.  Walgrens has had these on sale at two bags for $6 (that is 6 bags for $18).  There are 12 individually wrapped truffles to a bag.  They are VERY heat sensitive and should not be shipped in hot weather unless in a special cold pack, and then by express shipment (provided by some candy sources if you buy online).",

I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they can't call it an extract is because it wasn't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor.<br />The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified, the texture is a little bit like honey, I think it's the glycerin.<br /><br />Going to buy again for sure.",

With the lastest pet food disaster, I never want to be in the position again of worrying about the safety of their food.  My dogs are small and the bite size hearts are perfect for them--they come in other sizes for the Medium & large dog.  The zip-lock packaging is great too in keeping them fresh.  Check out their dog food.  Again, I am so glad I found dog food that my dogs love that is prepared to a higher standard of organic, wholesome ingredients. What impressed me the most, the chicken are fed a veg. diet so no hormones, or antiobiotics--that means the chickens are not feed cancer ridden diseased meat.  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0002ML8CA >Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Chicken Formula (12.5-lb bag)</a>",
            "I grabbed one of these on a whim while shopping at Northern Tool.  I was in need of a low calorie, high protein snack and this fit the bill.  Little did I know that it was going to taste so great.  The flavor is so incredible.  There is a hint of sweet and and hint of spice to give it a bit of a kick.  The fact that I can enjoy it as an occasional snack without it wrecking my daily calorie intake, absolutely puts this one over the top.<br /><br />Highly recommended!",
            "The consistency of the chocolate is nice, but the caramel is too chewy and way, way, way over salted.  The ingredients to this candy seem very inconguous and ill matched - and I'm a candy and dessert hound.  I ended up throwing it away, which I almost never do to candy.",

            "I don't usually drink espresso so this was a bit strong for me.  The flavor, however, was very good.  I drank part of it straight and mixed the rest with some milk and ice.  I preferred it prepared as an iced latte.  That is the great feature of this drink, it gives you so many options.  You can use it in recipes (Tiramisu comes to mind), frappes, iced lattes, lattes or just straight as a slightly sweet espresso. This would also be a great mixer for coffee cocktails. It would be nice to keep a can or two on hand in the pantry.  I personally probably wouldn't just be grabbing a can to drink straight because that's just not my thing but for anyone who likes strong coffee flavor it would be a treat.  If you're going on a camping trip, hike or to any location that you won't be able to brew a cup, packing a can of illy issimo would be a wonderful alternative.",

She was the first one to send me some and since then I have been ordering it myself.<br /><br />I have tried both of the blends offered by Camp Dog; Original and the Non-Typical Milder Blend sold here and while they are both good, I have to say I prefer the original because of the heat. I have been using this on just about everything; steaks, chicken, fish and my favorite - pork chops or tenderloin. A very easy recipe to make that gets rave reviews in my house is to sprinkle the seasoning generously on the chops and grill in a pan. Once they are about 5 minutes from being done add 2 Tb of honey & 1 Tb of butter.  It makes a sweet, but spicy glaze on the chops.  You can also mix up a Tb of brown sugar, dijon mustard and water, then cook using the same instructions for a different flavor.<br /><br />Two of their other products I can also recommend are the Fish Fry and Hush Puppy Mix.  Both are easy to make and just as delicious!",
            "I bought these at my local RiteAid to try and am now hooked. The combination of sweet and salty is something I usually crave. This isn't for everybody, but I think M&Ms has really got a winner here. The sweet part of the snack are Peanut MMs and Shortbread Cookies. The cookies are indeed sweet, but not overpowering and have a rich buttery flavor that I think enhances the overall mix. The cookies aren't soft, so they add a good crunch to the mix. The mix tends to settle, with lighter objects (the pretzels) landing on top and the MMs on the bottom, so be sure to mix it before grabbing a handful to be able to fully experience the perfect balance of sweet and salty. I've tried the dark chocolate and milk chocolate mix, but hands down my favorite is Peanut. Milk mix was too sweet and so was Dark mix with the raisins.",
            "I received the shipment on time.  As soon as I saw the box left at my door my first response was that I was surprised that the carrier had even left it.  It was smashed to about 60%-70% of its origional size.  The whole top was caved in.  I opened all three bags and they were all nothing but  bits and crumbs , not  chips .

            "Chicken wing sauces are easy to overthink. The purist wants nothing but Frank's Red Hot and butter (conveniently packaged, premade, by Frank's). The more adventurous may try something like a Parmesan-garlic or mango habanero. But among the mainstream wing aficionados, the only debate is how hot and what kind of heat to apply.<br />Budweiser's Hot and Spicy packs a nice amount of heat, with a vinegary tang and good pepper flavor. It's not so hot that is sears the taste buds, but it may be too hot for more delicate palates. If you like your wings spicy, but not bar-challenge-sign-a-waiver hot, this sauce should suit you well.<br />My only complaint is that the sauce is on the thin side, and doesn't cling to a naked wing all that well. I'll try it again with a breaded wing, which should solve that problem.<br />Definitely worth a try for the wing connoisseur.",

            "I've been drinking International Coffee for 35 years now.  My elder sister drank Suisse Mocha when I went to her house, and the instant I hit adulthood, she offered me a cup. I really liked it, but later, my budget did not allow for it, so I tried making my own from a combination of cocoa mix and instant coffee.  What I got, was sick.  After that, I was done with Suisse Mocha, and considered buying other flavors my one little vice in life.<br /><br />Over the years, flavors I have liked--or not--have come and gone.  I loved the Kahlua flavor; it's been discontinued.  But every time I see a chance to load up on these hard-to-get coffees (at least where I live, in a major metropolitan city), I grab the best.  I think the Vanilla Bean Latte and the Vanilla Caramel are entirely scrumptious.  The directions give you an idea of how much to use; I judge by the size of the mug in my hand.  I don't mess with hot milk; this is all the coffee I'm drinking, and I am not awake enough to heat milk!  Hot water, just like instant coffee, and then, if I have it (so at home yes, at work no) I add a little milk and stir.<br /><br />I write this in the hope that the product will become more popular and therefore easier to find, but what may happen is that you folks out there will grab up the last few of my delicious brew.  Well, it's written now, and I guess I will publish it.<br /><br />Amazon, thanks for hooking me up with my hard-to-find coffee!",

It's food grade plasma that is separated from the red blood cells and posts no risk to the cat.<br /><br />The canned food is also of superior quality and I'd recommend this brand to anyone who wants to feed their cat wholesome and palatable food.",

            "Our boy is eleven-months old today. He's now got six teeth (4 uppers, 2 lowers) and we're giving him more and more solid foods. My wife spots items like these Graduates Mini Fruits and just has to try them out. The boy loves them and puts a good effort into chewing them up. The only problem we've had is that if he is given more than one at a time he tries to get all of them in his mouth at once. So far there's been no choking problems, but we worry. In any case, he loves them and the small treat will often quiet him down when he's cranky.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",

            "The best green tea I've had, and at such a good price!  I thought $25 for the same size package was a good deal until I saw this.  I've seen the same size pack go for $40 at a local shop.  The flavor is very floral with no bitterness at all unless you overbrew it.<br />The tea is fascinating to watch when it brews.  The 'pearls' will unroll into little branches, which are the tender shoots of the tea plant.  Because the tea shoots are large, there is no need for an infuser since they stay at the bottom of the cup.  In fact, the metal of the infuser can give the delicatley flavored tea a funny metallic taste.  So I don't reccommend using a metal infuser, if you are squeamish about seeing your tea leaves at the bottom of the cup, go for a nice ceramic infuser.  They make teacups with a built in ceramic strainer, one of those would be ideal for this tea.<br />One caution: it is done when it TASTES done, even if it doesn't LOOK done.  It's a very pale colored brew.  I live at 6500 feet in elevation, and I usually have to boil the water to get it to brew to the proper strength within ten minutes because of the lower boiling point.  At sea level, use almost boiling water.  The directions say brew time is 90 seconds or less, but it usually takes three to five minutes depending on how strong you like it.",

I can't imagine how they justify charging this much money for something so small . . . not to mention the shipping!  I was very disappointed.

But not compatable with reusable K-CUP??? Whats up with that??? I am considering returning this item.<br /><br />According to other reviews the OfficePro line may have a better pump compared to the Home line. Although louder and more vibration, equilavant to a loud aquarium air pump. I considered the compact B130 DeskPro, or even the other Mini editions can take up to 2-3 minutes to brew.<br /><br />Other considerations, this has a water resevior where the B130 did not, I quickly came to apreciate the benefit to having the resevior. Was disapointed unable to hook up a water line, that would have been great. The metal drip plate rattles during the pump priming setup, it is very annoying but just removing the plate and just using the bottom plastic catch below to hold the cup for brewing works well. Note another reviewer suggested using a mouse pad underneath to help with the vibration noise. Unable to reproduce rattle for the video, appears to have gotten better aftere a few days. Be sure your countertop is level.<br /><br />As earlier mentioned perhaps the biggest negative is the OfficePro line is not compatable with the reusable K-cup filters, as I prefer larger, stronger coffee and would like to use more/my own coffee grounds. Note one could run a double 6oz size to get 12oz. Another reviewer noted that the EKOBREW is compatable. So I will give that a go.<br /><br />Note it is highly recommended to use DISTILLED water to prevent scalling. It will be interesting how this unit stands up over time, currently just using filtered water.<br /><br />Oh yeah got this for $120 sold and shipped by Amazon.",

            "My dogs pretty much eat healthy snacks like dried chicken, dehydrated sweet potato sticks, fresh carrot sticks and the like. They turn their noses up at most store brand dog treats and bones, but they love these. One of my dogs has a very sensitive stomach, too, but has never had any issues with these. They're crunchy low-odor treats that make a great little snack. They're too big to use as a treat if you're going to be handing out multiple treats for a training session, though, and attempting to cut them will crack the outer crunchy shell.  In addition to the treats themselves, I love the 40 oz plastic jar. It keeps them fresh and is reusable. I once bought a box of these in the store that some creepy crawlies had gotten into, so I love that the plastic jar keeps the bugs out, too!",

            "I think this was the best purchase decision I made all year. When my kids were little I never let baked goods from the store in the house and every night ground flour to bake with but drifted away from that as they got older and flew the nest. After years of buying fairly adequate bread, crackers whatnot at the store I decided to go back to making my own.  I bought a Wondermill Jr. hand mill and based on previous reveiws here I ordered this Great River Organic Milling Hard Red Spring Wheat.<br /><br />The other reviewers were correct this is absolutely fabulous wheat. It has a very high gluten content and makes a very dark flavorful satisfying loaf.<br /><br />I would especially recommend this to anyone new to bread-making. I don't think you can make a bad load with this some good yeast and a bit of elbow grease.  I used the SAF Instant you can order buy the pound just like the big bakeries do. It's just plain good yeast.<br /><br />The best thing about this wheat is you can make each loaf for less than a dollar =))<br /><br />Oh...this wheat is not good for pie crusts pastry kind of things...the gluten content is too high and will make anything like that tough.  This is to make glorious bread.",

I have sprinkled it on food other than french fries. It's really good on popcorn too!  I have sprinkled some on cooked rice. It gave it really good flavor. I also fried some flour tortillas and sprinkled some of this on the tortilla before putting anything else on it. It's really good on meat as well. This is a very versatile seasoning. I am definitely going to be ordering more of it. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. It's definitely worth the price. The 9 ounce bottle is bigger than I thought it would be.<br /><br />Thank you Fries Seasoning for such a great, versatile seasoning.",

Thick ones have to be stirred while cooking or they will stick together and not cook properly. Sometimes they stick even if you stir. These thin ones do not stick.<br /><br />Cooking 3 boxes at a time seems to work OK.<br /><br />We usually eat them with spaghetti meat sauce.<br /><br />The boxes say,  Product of Thailand .",

I love iced drinks so I thought I would try an instant green tea first just to see how I liked it.  This stuff is amazing! It's got such a great, fresh taste to it, perfectly sweetened, light and if I didn't know I would never guess it was green tea.  I went by the other reviewers and used less, about 3 scoops instead of 4 for two quarts and it was absolutely delicious and addicting!  Highly recommend this tea!",

However, I'm now mixing it with plain greek non-fat yogurt and it makes a great dip for carrots, chips, veges, french fries, etc.<br /><br />If you're trying to stay healthy and want a tasty dip, get this stuff and make your own.

Its not blisteringly hot, but its actually edible and tasty not like that extract crap like Daves Insanity etc etc... Buy the 16oz jar if you can, its a far better deal. If you like basics like Melinda's XXX hot sauce this is at least two steps up. Bhut Jolokia has an inherent citrus/smoke flavor with heat that really builds. Not super hot at first, but give it a minute and it really starts to hit to kick in and trigger a diaphoretic response. Sweat as you may, you'll be happy you tried it. Great on basics like tortilla chips, enchilada, eggs, and pizza. Mmmm...",

At first, I thought my memory of how good they were was just faulty, but my daughter told me she felt the others had been much better, too.  I contacted Pamela's Products about the problem, and after some discussion, they sent me replacement cookies.  These cookies made me fall in love with this product all over again - they had an enjoyable texture and those lovely little taste treats of crystallized ginger pieces that leave the mouth tingling for awhile after the cookie is gone.

It is enhanced by  the all natural flavor or bergamot orange , which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.

            "Thanks to another reviewer, I learned today that Greenies contain a synthetic, controversial ingredient, menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), that is highly questionable and considered by many experts to be toxic. I will no longer take that chance with my pet just because the FDA hasn't gotten around to banning it. Based upon the information I have read about it, the only apparent reason to add MSB to pet food is to claim it as a nutritious ingredient, namely, the k-vitamins that come from green plants. In other words, the basis of  Greenies  is a cheap synthetic version of the real thing. That must be why the ingredient label describes the stuff as  source of vitamin k activity. <br /><br />Furthermore, although my 3 year-old cat has been eating between 6-12 Greenies every day, he is currently in need of advanced dental work. I see no evidence that these so-called dental treats are effective and they may very well be harmful.",

Googling  corn gluten meal  shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google  U.S. Patent 5,030,268  you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.",

This food is so good and devoid of filler, that your dogs will only need to eat a smaller amount.  It is rich enough that they will feel satisfied and full with that smaller amount.  Be sure to consult with your vet on how to make the change from your current food to Precise Holistic.  It is such a change in quality, that you need to make the switch very slowly so your dog's system can adequately get used to all its goodness without digestive upset.  But it's worth the small attention you'll have to pay to the switch over.  Now that our dogs are used to it, they love it.  Even our finicky eater!",

            "I want my pizza base to be thin but with a nice bread texture and crisp crust. The nice texture comes from  OO  flour, which makes a soft dough. The gluten percentage is correct in this flour, so it rises nicely and rolls out easily and can be stretched to the edges of the pan or stone without tearing. Really makes a nice traditional pizza.",

            "These are the best mini-graham snack I've tried, and they're adorable.  Great in the car, on the plane, much better than drive-through and gas station fare.  Annie's ingredients allow me to rationalize that it's not that bad, health-wise, to polish off a whole bag of bunnies.  It probably isn't good, but I'm sure it could be worse.",

The chocolate has changed color and looks and tastes like powdered chocolate.  I have had this bar before, and this is not what they are supposed to look like.  I won't send them back, because it's not worth my time to send one box back, but I would not buy from this seller, Nevada Manna again.......",
            "These groats have worked out very well for sprouting and I have been able to make wonderful buckwheat waffles from the flour created from the ground, sprouted groats. The lid seals well, so there should not be any problems regarding freshness. The quality of the groats is very good- I have not found any  off  groats. Whenever the time comes that I actually get through all five pounds, I would definitely purchase this product again!",
            "I must say that I was hesitant at first to try these - in this flavor... Salt & Vinegar style chips are my all time favorite! But I was not disappointed in the least! These  crisps  were spot on - all the crunch and texture I expected from a potato chip - and an explosion of flavor in my mouth from the first bite! Now I can have my favorite chips the healthy way! Way to go Medifit!",

For a bit of flavoring, I added a small amount of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce, an Asian treat from Thailand. Good lunch. Good mix of nutritional ingredients. Excellent sardines, by the way.

Although I probably could have located some prickly pear syrup locally -- we live in southeast Arizona -- it's often just easier to order through Amazon, so that's what we did.  It's delicious and is very good on pancakes, waffles, french toast -- anything you would normally use a syrup on.  I may try to incorporate it into cooking at some point.",
            "This coffee is very hard to find. Excellent flavor, everyone I have let taste it loves it. Wish it were a little cheaper. Used to be able to get it in Cleveland Ohio for alot less. But never make it there anymore. But worth a little extra cost.",
            "I purchased this tea after seeing all of the great reviews, and I was not disappointed. Once it arrived, I immediately opened it and was delighted by the fragrance of the tea. I took several deep breaths before actually making the tea it smells so good. It is very comforting, and now one of my new favorites. If you like fragrant teas like I do (I'm also a huge fan of Jasmine tea), then you want this tea! I like how you can reuse the tea bags, although the second cup isn't quite as nice. It's nice plain, but I feel like the comfy aroma just begs to be complimented with a little milk and honey. I will definitely be ordering more of this tea and more from Harney and Sons, if only to get the adorable tins the tea comes in!",
            "Not sure what these other guys are tasting, but these seeds along with the Buffalo Style Ranch are my favorite ones ever. Being a baseball player I always eat seeds, and I won't eat anything but these two flavors now, they're tops in my book.",

They are crunchy and flavorful, like eating a fruit candy, only much healthier and  reduced guilt ! I especially like eating them plain or over greek yogurt.<br /><br />They are unfortunately pretty expensive, but I find them worth the cost. The large pouches last quite a while, though I recommend transferring them to snap-top containers to maintain maximum crunch and freshness. I've ordered them (and the Just Fruit Salad variety, also quite yummy) several times through Amazon.com and have never had a problem.",

            "If you're looking for genuine Styrian Pumpkinseed Oil, you're looking at the right product.<br /><br />Styrian pumpkinseed oil is pressed from the seeds of Styrian pumpkins, which grow only in Styria, Austria.<br /><br />My husband grew up eating salads dressed with a simple pumpkinseed and vinegar dressing, and raved about it for years. His grandmother would visit  the old country  every few years, leaving America with a suitcase full of Levi's and coming home with a suitcase full of meats and cheeses. One thing she always brought back was plain plastic bottles filled with this nutty green oil.<br /><br />After scouring every grocery store I went to for years on end, I finally caved and bought this very expensive bottle of oil. When he saw it his face lit up. When he sniffed it he drooled. Yesterday I made him a salad with it as a dressing, and he just about died.<br /><br />This is the real thing. If you want pumpkinseed oil, you will not be disappointed. There is nothing else like it.<br /><br />The shipping was pretty hefty, at $10 for the single bottle. I assumed that was because it was coming right from Austria and was a little dismayed when I saw my box came from right here in the States. It was so well packaged, though, that it was worth it. If the bottle had been broken I'd have been far more upset.",

She takes one look at the box and her ears go down and she just turns her back and walks away before I can even get it out. They are just too dry and crumbly, I guess. When I open up a pack of the new Cesar filet mignon treats, on the other hand, she starts to jump in the air as high as my waist! She knows the packaging!

Well Amazon ca canceled my subscription order when I got a good deal on it after I canceled it right after that is.<br /><br />Seems they don't wanna honor it also they deleted the order from my history without notice so I wont have records to back it up.<br /><br />It was for 5.50 or so during the sale after sub and save.  I first bought them for 6.50 or so after s. s.,<br /><br />They deleted it right before the 2nd delivery and me canceling on them for charging me the 8 dollar deal. Why do I want that.  Yep always cancel order on them after getting the first shipment. They wont honor the lower price deals anymore if you get them. Well I did change my cc number so maybe they had a error and just wants an excuse to not honor their contract, who knows.  But dont I would not trust s. s.  There is always a catch in good deals.<br /><br />It's a bait and switch. Obviously like all the retailers. They hate careful consumers.  A knowledgeable consumer is retailers worse nightmare.:P<br /><br />Well same old corporation ways.<br /><br />Anyway Now for the cereal review. Pretty decently healthy and tasty for regular cereals . But like all processed foods the stuff they use is processed so the canola oil/veg oil they use is crap and then extra sugar etc.<br /><br />If you do care then try to buy the natural organic cereals, of course even though they take less work they charge more. lame yes less work more pay because there is less supply.  Well this is great and cheap as long as you just want processed food and is less than 11 cent per oz.<br /><br />Otherwise I'll just get it from my local supermarket since its about the same price when on sale.",

He only has a few dog friends and this cake was good enough for him and 3 dog friends.  And enough for another day to eat.  Yes its tiny but easy to make and my dog LOVED it!  I'm ordering more because its hard to find, easy to make, and I did try it to see if it was any good, it is very light in sweetness, icing is kind of bland but something bout the texture of this cake my dog and his friends loved. :)",
            "In general I have always found NOW foods to be a company that takes quality seriously.  I have bought flax seed from other sources before, only to find it rancid when I opened the bag.  This product was fresh as can be, and has stored well for me since I bought it a few months ago.  Not only does NOW sell a fresh product, but Amazon must store it properly or have a very high turnover rate, because the product I received was very fresh.  Storage makes a difference with flax.<br /><br />The price for 6 bags was lower than I've seen elsewhere.  I store one open bag at a time in my refrigerator and keep the rest in the freezer.  They have kept well for me.<br /><br />I use milled flax seed to make a variety of foods, mostly homemade granola and low-carbohydrate, high-fiber baked goods.  It serves as a good flour replacer in some recipes.",

Since there was no damage to the outside packaging, and there were air pillows all around the plastic shrink wrapped set of shakers, it looks like Amazon sent these out with the tops all ready off of the shakers.  This is not the first time something like this has happened.  Amazon, stop sending out products that are damaged!  I order a ton of stuff, because the prices are so good, and the free shipping.

Great with meals and with drinks.  Packaging was fine - a few chips around the edges of some packs but no major damage.  For years I prepared them by roasting over the gas stove but have started using the microwave more often - about a minute on high is perfect and you can make a batch all at once.",

            "I have tried three kinds of St. John's Wort tea: Yogi, Traditional Medicines, and this brand.  For hot tea, Traditional Medicines was my favorite, due to its pleasant minty flavor.  Yogi made a nice hot tea, too, with a more cinnamon and licorice flavor to it.  As a hot tea, The Republic of Tea Happy Tea wasn't my favorite.  I guess I'm just not a fan of strong fruit flavors in my hot tea.  However, as an iced tea, I thought it was quite delicious, and I'm incredibly glad I tried it that way.  St John's Wort doesn't have its full effect unless you're having quite a few glasses each day, and when it's hot out or you're very busy, it can be quite a pain to brew a new cup every few hours.  But as an iced tea, I can make a lot at once and store it in a pitcher in the fridge.  On a hot day, the lovely peach flavor is quite refreshing.  Even my boyfriend has started drinking it.  I definitely plan on buying it again, especially with summer approaching.",
            "This is a fun and unique gift pack.  Great for teens and young folks (who don't need supervision in the kitchen).  Instructions were straight forward and the end result turned out great!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />First step involved boiling the tapioca pearls.  Just make sure you have enough (if not additional water in the pot).  Because of the excess starches, these pearls need room to expand and soak.  Don't over cook.<br /><br />After drained and cooled, you make (shake) the packet ingredients.  Our favorite was strawberry, but Mango came in a close second.  Have not tried the tarrot yet (fear of the unknown).<br /><br />We even tried standard lemonade (our own making) with the bubble pearls and it was good as well.<br /><br />Don't forget to get extra straws.  You can't suck these pearls through standard sippy straws.<br /><br />Happy bubbling.",
            "Before I get into the meat and potatoes of my review, I'd like to point out that the front of the packet reads,  Sweet & Salty.   THERE IS NO SALT IN THIS PRODUCT.  The ingredients listed are:  Popping corn, coconut oil, sugar, beta carotene.<br /><br />Now, if you make this in your Whirley Pop according to the directions on the back of the packet, the sugar caramelizes.  Not only does the sugar caramelize, but the crank is VERY hard to turn once the sugar starts melting; this makes it very easy, indeed, to break the delicate, plastic crank on your lid.  What you ultimately end-up with is sticky, brown popcorn, and a BIG mess to clean out of your pot and off of the lid (and cleaning that lid isn't exactly what I'd call  easy ).  My daughter, the Princess of Kettle Corn wrinkled her nose when she saw what it looked like, but being the trooper that she is, she ventured a taste...and (drum-roll, please) she declared,  Nope.  That DOES NOT taste like kettle corn! <br /><br />So, after tossing the whole first batch and soaking the pot for an hour to get some kernels  unglued,  I tried again.  I opened the side of the packet that contains the popcorn and sugar FIRST (being careful not to open the oil side) and emptied the contents into a wire mesh strainer over a bowl.  I shook the strainer so that ALL of the sugar was separated from the popcorn kernels.  I reserved the sugar and mixed a little popcorn salt with it.  THEN, I opened the oil side and put that into the Whirley Popper along with the (now sugar-free) popcorn kernels.  I popped the popcorn as I usually would.  When it was finished, and still VERY hot, I took a large bowl with a tight-fitting lid and filled the bottom with hot popcorn; I sprinkled the sugar/salt mixture over this.  Then I added more popcorn; then more sugar/salt, repeating the process until the bowl was filled to within two inches of the top.  Then I put the lid on the bowl, and tossed and turned and shook until I was fairly certain that the popcorn was adequately covered with the sugar/salt mixture.  My daughter tasted it and liked it much better.<br /><br />My family LOVES our Whirley Popper and Wabash Valley Farms popcorn, but this product (in my opinion) is a dud, and an expensive one at that.  If you want my advice, use the Real Theater Popcorn packet and sprinkle some extra-fine sugar on it in the bowl (not the popper) while it's still hot -- you won't have to clean burned sugar out of the pot (and gunk off of the lid), you'll save money and you'll have fresh, non-microwaved kettle corn.",

            "I will be the first to admit. I love Amazon. I love the bargains, my customer service experience has always been excellent. I love the bargain price of prime & benefits of being a prime member.<br />I had been buying Herseys with almonds in the 6 bar / 4 package sets.  All were bought & filled from Amazon, so it seems like I am compairing  apples to apples  so to speak.<br />My expectations were exceeded. I was receiving them quickly & most important..... FRESH!!!<br />So I thought....   Hmmmm...  The other Herseys were coming fast & super fresh (expiration dates of 03-2013, a bit over a year away from right now, with tonight being 29 February 2012.)  Maybe I should graduate to the 36 count.  After all, they will last longer. <br />So I did go for the 36 count box. The first time I have ever bought one anywhere.<br />When the box arrived tonight, I opened it & looked at the expiration date. To my horror, it is less than three months away.<br />I know it might sound crazy. They are in date. I understand that. But it makes all the difference in the world in the taste to buy & eat one with the longest time you can find to expiration.  Try it sometime.  Take one bar with a date of expiration  with about five months away, open it and take a look at it.  Usually, in my experience, bars that are five months or less from expiration tend to be easily broken, dry, crumbly, stale tasting,  The almonds are usually not tasty at all.<br />Then get a bar with nine months or more to go before expiration.  Open the wrapper.  Notice the appearance of the bar, not crumbling or dry looking, the chocolate is fresh looking & smells wonderful.  The chocolate melts in your mouth smoothly & the taste is fabulous!  The almonds are fresh & appealing.<br /> I 1000% believe you will honestly taste a difference between the two bars and most likely you will want to finish eating the fresher bar.<br />When I shop for food, the first thing I check is the date of expiration.  I have found things out of date by months & still on shelves for sale.  That is a bit disturbing to me.  It happens more often than I like.<br />This is the first item in food that I have ever bought from Amazon that I was disappointed in.<br />For the $28 + I paid, I want to savor the little candies. These I know I will not enjoy. I am sending it back, unopened.  Tomorrow.<br />Still love my Amazon. I hate to write a bad review, but I thought that if there are any other folks out there like me that like to receive very fresh & tasty chocolate bars, that the batch I received, were not it.<br /><br />********** UPDATE **********  16 March 2012<br /><br />I am a bit late in writing this update. my apologies.<br /> I wanted to say  Thank You  to Amazon & Mohammed K. in customer service for promptly contacting me & going out of their way, in my opinion, to make things right!<br />I really appreciate all you have done for me & once again, this is another example of great reasoning for me to continue to give my business & quite a bit of my monthly budget in both discretionary & essential spending dollars to your company.<br />I will continue to do business with Amazon.<br />Thanks Amazon for being a business I am proud to spend my money with & for making me feel like my business & my complete satisfaction matters to your company!",

            "It's very difficult to find healthy prepared foods that are low in salt.  Dr. Joel Fuhrman's line of canned food is a wonderful find for me.  I wish it was organic, so I lop off a star for that, but I haven't been able to find anything else like this out there, organic or not.  Most  low salt  foods are really still pretty high in salt, but Vitabeanavegamin is an exception, with only 110mg of salt in the entire can (4% of USRDA).  It takes a little while to get used to low salt foods, because we're all so used to having salt in everything (especially soup!), but it's true that if you give your taste buds a few days to adjust, you'll start to find  normally  salted foods way too salty, and the flavor of the truly low salt foods just pops right out.<br />Nutritionally, this soup is great.  To be honest, I don't eat it as a soup but rather as it comes out of the can, which is very dense (even denser than a stew).  The whole can is 280 calories, with a total of 110mg of salt, 1g of fat, 980% of daily requirements for vitamin A, 70% of vitamin C, and 20% each of calcium and iron.  Even better, there's 14g of fiber (58% USRDA) and 14g of protein.  After I eat a can, I actually feel  energized .<br />Also very good are Dr. Fuhrman's Supreme Greens and Dr. Fuhrman's Moroccan Chick Peas.",

A full day's worth of whole grains in one serving--doesn't get better than that!  There are several types of grain in the ingredients, not just whole wheat.<br /><br />It should be noted that this does not have the taste of regular pasta--I doubt that could ever be done.  But it does taste good!  It is its own kind of noodle, and for some dishes I don't know how I'd like it (baked pasta, for instance, though I haven't tried.)  It goes well with sauce. It is very good with just a little butter, salt and pepper (go for sea salt for the best results.)  The texture is similar to regular angel hair, which is in my opinion essential.

They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto,  The Reincarnation of Tea . Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some  natural flavors  in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only  real  ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.<br />****",

They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.",
            "My cats loved this dry food. For me, it's a toss up between this brand and Merrick's Before Grain. They are both extremely high in protein with no additives and added calories. My obese cat definitely doesn't need that in his life. When I fed this to them as a treat, they took to it right away. Even my finicky cat came up to me when it was time to give them some of this food. They both ran, meowing, and circled my legs until I was done pulling the contents out of the bag. I was amazed to see my finicky one react that way. He has only reacted that was with Merrick brand foods, both wet and dry, and Innova Evo.",

I dislike corn with all my heart, besides, I am slightly allergic to it. I have tried it though to try to make it up for stupidly buying something I should have not. And it tastes bad - I mean, it has NO taste whatsoever. I thought I would have a gluten-free alternative to a nice taste of pasta, instead I have got the corn horror with no gratification to my pasta cravings. I am very, very sad, but it's my fault: I should read  labels  better. I would have returned, it, but it's way to heavy to pay for shipping. Sadly Sad.",

            ":: Stash White Christmas White Tea ::<br /><br />Having read that white tea is even more healthful than green, more antioxidants, and also that its flavor tends towards the light and mellow, which would be good for my ice tea mixes ... I went on a hunt in AMZN's aisle for white teas. This type seemed to be generally a bump up in price compared to the general pop, like mostlly in the $18+ range. Then found this Stash blend at only $13, so for the savings, I figured that I could overlook the part about Christmas on the packaging.<br /><br />I was also happy about the choice of blend on this. White tea, ginger root, peppermint. Ginger is absolutely my favorite flavor for ice tea already. And a little peppermint in there sounded good, too.  Now that I have it, comment on the taste of the blend. The ginger in there is only very subtle. Which is fine, as I can add extra ginger tea bags to my ice tea batches -- and probably better as is for drinking just a cup of hot, straight tea.  The peppermint is distinctive. Overall, the taste of the blend is quite crisp and light, with an easy-going flavorful tinge from the peppermint and ginger.<br /><br />When I tried this tea, I was instantly pleased, and made a note to buy Stash brand again. (AMZN is running a promo on the brand this month, so that works well...)<br /><br />I am glad to have discovered Stash, and am eager to try a few more varieties. My previous experience in brands of teas what limited by what has been available at my grocery stores. Lipton, Celestial Seasonings, Yogi, Triple Leaf. Recently via AMZN shopping I've bought and tried three brands new to me.<br /><br />  o Bentley's. High quality green tea.<br /><br />  o Stash. White tea blend - very nice!<br /><br />  o Clipper. Blend of white tea + ginger. Tastes dry and messy and old.<br /><br />Glad that Clipper wasn't my only intro to white tea, since it was such a loser. The Stash got here the same week, and it, in contrast, was a very satisfying acquisition. I'm hoping for equally good results when this month I try out Stash in another variety, like probably a Green + ginseng. Or possibly a black, or even one of the chais ...",

            "I guess I was expecting something like the Campbells Mushroom soup but that is my fault since I did not notice the absence of the word 'condensed'.  However, the directions do say to ADD a can of water to this little can before heating.  But it is like drinking flavored water before you add any additional water.  I do like that there is quite a nice quantity of mushrooms included.  But....I find two main problems with this soup: it tasted like a bowl full of flavored salt and it is so loaded with Monosodium Glutamate that I woke up with a headache the next morning!!  This is what a large dose of MSG does to me so I know that they had to add lots of MSG to make this soup have any flavor at all.  I'll have to use it not as a soup but as a topping for casseroles or when baking chicken even though it is so dilute and loaded with salt and MSG.  Maybe I'll just give them to the local food bank.  The can may say it has 1875 mg of salt per small 10.5 ounce can but it tastes like it has at least twice that amount in it.....and this is a very small can of soup! That's nearly one whole day's worth of allowable salt per one small can.  And ofcourse the neurotoxicity of the MSG is soooo scary too.  No, I can not recommend this soup to anyone!  Heck, I won't ever buy any Rokeach product ever again!  Stay away from this disceptively dangerous little can!",

If you can, buy Fauchon or Reese's both of which are far superior and offer far more for the price asked. If, however, you have no other access then this is, as I said, adequate.

            "This coffee, packed in the new VUE format for Keurig Vue machines, is absolutely a clone of coffee you can buy at (ahem) certain donut shops that are found all over the US. Which shop? Well, if you are in New England, you call those ubiquitous shops by a nickname that rhymes with  BUNKIES. <br /><br />The VUE cup is a #5 plastic sieve-like cup, with an insert of coffee filter, well packed with your favorite blend of coffee for the Keurig and topped with the foil seal. It pops into the Keurig Vue, and you have a choice of regular or strong on the touch screen. After you are finished brewing, you can remove the VUE cup and pull off the foil. The coffee and filter pull out as a unit (if you don't tear or puncture it) and you can recycle the #5 plastic cup if your local recycling takes them. The foil sometimes wants to tear and spill coffee all over, so if you are doing this at your office, do it over a waste paper basket. I would compost the coffee and filter, except that the foil is not compostable and not easily removable; I suppose after it cooled, I could do a very messy job of pulling away the foil and dumping the grounds into my compost bucket. Beware if you are trying to dispose of this right after you brew; it is a bit warm on the finger. I didn't burn myself, but it wasn't exactly pleasant, either.<br /><br />BACK to the coffee, how did it taste? I gave it a good lashing of evaporated milk and some sugar and by George, it tasted exactly like light ( regular  to you New Englanders) donut shop coffee. I tried some black before I adulterated it and it was a bit woody and bitter. It's a medium roast, no burnt taste and a medium dark amber color, not the greenish-black dense color of say, a Sumatra.<br /><br />If you choose 6 oz rather than standard 80z, you get a brew that is rather like European coffee (German, to be specific.) I set it on  6oz  and  strong  and I had a cup that was very similar to Tschibo, Eduscho, Jacob Kroenung, or Dallmayr, all typical German coffees. Rather good, in fact. Not aromatic, but very smooth and stood up to a few Tbs of evaporated milk and just a touch of sugar. This is a somewhat sweet blend, so it seems to reject more than a little sugar, unless you love sugary-sweet coffee. I assume there is a good amount of Central American coffee in this blend as the Germans favor Guatemalan.<br /><br />If you have a Keurig VUE and you like donut shop coffee, this is surprisingly exact. I believe it is one of the most popular blends sold by Keurig coffee cup makers, and I can see why. It's not the coffee I prefer (my absolute fave is Papua New Guinea) but it's absolutely spot-on if that's your preferred java. I knocked off a star, not for the taste, which is absolutely as advertised, but for the cups, which are frankly a pain to accomplish the vaunted recycling and which are pretty pricey compared to the current K-cups. However, they say landfills are seeing an onslaught of those white cups, so ultimately, recycling Keurig cups is a good thing in my opinion. I just find it a bit messy to do it and worry if, in a busy office, the chance of grounds all over the counter is going to discourage the very act the cups are trying to achieve.",

            "I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert.  Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores.  I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun.  We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor.  It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce.  In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like.  (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor.  Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue.  As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.",

            "*****<br />Ashby's Japanese Green Tea is a distinctive, strong, great-flavored Japanese tea. Nothing wimpy or mild about it, and I'm glad, because it's so enjoyable. I made a large thermos with one tea bag, left the tea bag in, and drank it for several hours, and it never got bitter. I then made more tea with the same tea bag. The flavor is definitely Asian and I could drink cup after cup. It smells great, too.<br /><br />Ashby's of London writes this about Japanese Green Tea:  From Japan, this pan-fired tea is lightly rolled and dried over a fire in a large flat bottom pan. This tea contains the desirable  Polyphenols  that have been reported to be a cancer fighting substance. It has a very light, fresh taste and produces a transparent greenish colored brew.  I agree, but please note that the tea is distinctively flavored, not mild (which I really like) and delivers a wonderful tea experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, and if you enjoy Asian teas, or want a true green tea, you'll not go wrong here.<br />*****",

The fish comes out of the bag smelling fishy not fresh. Again all my opinions are based on that I'm used to top shelf very fresh or properly aged meats and fishes.

I noticed, when I didn't have Avoderm for a week, but did have Blue Buffalo which is also high quality, that my mix began to shed noticeably. When I bought more Avoderm, he hardly shed. That alone, is reasons for Avoderm. We also bath him with Avoderm shampoo which works effectively with this dog food. He is still on Prednisone, and I bought the largest bag of Avoderm available. With my schnauzer, I've noticed minute changes...no outside odor when she comes inside, breath smells better, even better mood and more running and jumping. She is older.<br /><br />Another benefit, and this is a huge plus, they seem to empty their bowls instead of letting it sit in the evening when they are fed. My mix is still of puppy age so I feed them  All Stages no grain  dogfood. It's not the cheapest, but the benefits make it worth it. I'm very pleased.",

            "I apologize in advance for being so enthusiastic. After you try this rice you will understand and appreciate where I am coming from. This is far and away the best rice I have ever had. This rice will totally spoil you. It is unlike any other rice you have ever had. All other rice is just rice. Come to think if it, all other rice just impersonates rice, and miserably. This the supreme king of rice. No other rice is like this rice. Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me. I have been eating it for years. Over ten at least. It is a bit pricy, but well worth it. It has a delicious, delicate and mild, but nutty like flavor that makes you just want to eat more. You'll feel like you don't even need anything else. Garnish it with something if you must. And you will want to eat it all the time. So prepare yourself. You can easily get carried away with this stuff. Even better, it has an absolutely wonderful, aromatic smell that is really a unique joy and will stimulate your desire eat it. In fact, you will probably want to cook it just to smell it in your kitchen after the first time. Then you will want to have your friends, neighbors and relatives over so they can experience it, smell it, taste it! I know I did. After your first experience you will become a Texmati Rice evangelist and want to tell everyone, and make it for everyone you know or at least get them some if they don't get their own so they won't experience life in such a state of depravation by not knowing RICE. I could not believe the wonderful smell of my kitchen when I cooked it. I said what is that. I have to do this again and often just for that effect. I have told many people about this rice and usually mention it at the check out counter, about how superb it is and that it is the best rice I have ever tasted. Cook up a cup or two and it makes the kitchen smell wonderful, just like it tastes. People will comment. I don't eat it all the time, but I would if I could. I wish I could buy it in twenty, fifty, or 100 pound bags. I would. I eat a pretty standard American diet. I like (long, brown and white) rice, but I don't eat rice all the time. This is an excellent product you can buy on faith. This is perfected rice made perfect. I see little way to improve rice over this. Easy to make in rice cooker or microwave or stove top pot. Just follow directions for perfect rice. This is THE rice to serve when entertaining. The organic variety is good too, almost as good, but I think the plain white had a slight edge over it. You might not notice, though, unless you compared. I like them both. I like these better then the other varieties. The brown is good but does not have the same described qualities of taste and smell. It beats any other Jasmine or Basmati rice on the market. Other Basmati's just don't stand up as tall. The flavor is not there. And why would you want to eat sticky rice unless you have no taste buds or are from Asia and grew up on the stuff, in which case I understand. If you favor very bland rice or have very delicate Asian taste buds then ok. You don't need soy sauce on this rice. In fact that would be a barbaric act for sure, but go ahead if you must. This is rice to taste for its own sake. This is THE RICE. Everything else is just rice substitute, ersatz rice, after this rice. I have found nothing that compares, even a close second on the market. Since this is a patented hybrid, I doubt I will. Get it! Try it! Enjoy! Don't wait. You won't regret it. P.S., in the Army we had a really great LRRP meal called 'Beef with Rice and Onions'. It was a freeze dried thing and very hard to come by. Mountain House I think was the contractor. It beat all C's by ten klicks. The freeze dried short white rice in it did not compare, but this is one of my favorite things to recreate with this rice. I have an incredible tri-tip recipe and this rice is just the ticket to go with it. BTW - my votes: best regular soy sauce - Kimlan by far. Tamari - San-J Low Sodium.",

I initially tried to order for our anniversary in the fall of 2011 and they were out of stock then. SO a few months later I tried to order again for Christmas but they were out then also. Finally I was able to order them in mid January and give them as a little Valentines day gift. So I am really happy I was able to eventually get this product but waiting 6 months and multiple failed orders for licorice is a bit silly. Agh, the crazy things people will do for live. HA!

Now for the taste, as soon as I had my first mouthful the first thought in my mind was  vegetables . There is a strong green vegetable flavor to it that I find extremely unpleasant. A friend of mine found that mixing this coffee with another companies dark roast coffee before brewing helped alleviate this problem.

It says that it is low fat, but the ingredient list has no fat at all on it so it must be very low. The sodium, on the other hand is a bit higher than I like, but the fiber content is good. The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free.

If you're doing Atkins this is a must buy and adds much needed flavor to dishes that involve plain chicken.",

            "My wife lived in London for three years and developed a variety of British tastes. One such item was for rice pudding or creamed rice. Not too long ago I spotted Ambrosia Creamed rice (in 15-ounce cans) on the shelves of my local Fresh and Easy Store (a British company). Well, I just had to try it.<br /><br />Creamed rice is not bad. It's rather bland for my tastes and perhaps it's meant to go with certain types of food.. It's low in fat and sodium and not particularly high in calories, so I don't feel guilty at all.I prefer it chilled. It's smooth and creamy and I'd judge it to be a good product. But, it might take me a while to develop a taste for it. Right for the moment, I find it overly bland.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",

If you have never had this product before, it tastes like a dijon with a stronger kick, almost like a chinese mustard.

The normal-sized cans seem to be unavailable even there so I took a chance and got the giant can, choosing light syrup.  Big mistake.  Either these figs have been in the can too long, or I should have gone for heavy syrup.  Too late now: I have a year's worth of nearly tasteless figs in light syrup.  Don't do it, Kadota fig lovers.  No idea why the nice-size cans are no longer made, but apparently we are living off antique Kadota figs.",

I cooked the porkchops on the drilling planks as well as in a pan. I wanted a true taste test. I am completely amazed at how.easy it was and how great it made the pork chops taste.<br />I soaked the planks for a couple hours in water.  Fixed the charcoal as per directions on the bag. When the grill was ready, I put the plank on the grill for a few minutes till it sizzled and put my chops on it. Closed the grill and continued with the rest of my cooking.  Just in case the plank started to burn, I had a spray bottle ready.  So easy. And they are reusable till there is no more wood to cook on. Then they can be put in with the charcoal.  I plan to cook veggies on them next. I am hooked.  The planks add an amazing flavor.",

I got 4 boxes w/ 6 cookie bars which equals 24.  If you do the math, that comes to $12.50 per box. Girl Scout cookies don't cost that much! (YET ANYWAY!)<br />I quickly called Amazon, I was told this was the price.  I told them I wanted to return them and get a full refund.  No problem, we'll do you one better: keep the cookies and we'll refund you the full price.  I LOVE Amazon.  But, someone definitely dropped the ball on this one.  To charge $12.50 for a box of 6 cookie bars is highway robbery.  BEWARE Amazon Customers!",
            "I bought these chips because of the lower sodium, and was I surprised!  Not only were they not as labeled, but they were exceedingly salty, more than chips not labeled as such.  60% reduced sodium?  Exactly how much more salt would there have been otherwise?  For a 1 oz. serving, the sodium is listed as 70 mg.  It happens I also have a bag of Cape Cod reduced fat (not reduced sodium) chips, and for the same size serving, the sodium is listed as 110 mg.  In a taste comparison, the Cape Cods were nowhere close to being as salty as the Boulder Canyon chips.  Now just maybe this first bag was a fluke because of malfunctioning salting machinery at the plant, but where's quality control?  So what to do with 11 bags of salt-laden chips?  Anybody out there with high blood pressure feeling suicidal?  On second thought, I'll open another bag and see if there's a difference.

            "Whether or not you like Nerds probably depends on when you were a child. I was not yet in high school in the early 80s and the sweet, tangy taste was a salve that help take my mind off homework, bullies and girls. After bus dropped me off at school, I'd run up the hill to the candy truck and buy a box or two. The grape and strawberry where the originals and my all time favorite. Eaten one at a time or in an overwhelming mouthful, I just loved 'em.<br /><br />Nerds were the  Candy of the Year  in 1985. They're thickly glazed with carnauba wax that gives them their hard crunch, and a flavored gloss. The center of each candy is composed of one or more complete, tangy sucrose crystals. If you were patient enough to let the coating dissolve in your mouth, then you could take it out and see that the crystals were clear. I was rarely so self retrained though, and would usually suck on their fun texture for a little while then just crunch away.<br /><br />The box has two openings at the top, one for each flavor. It was always a mystery which side I'd finish first, since I went back and forth between the two. I tried them again recently, and though my taste buds have evolved over the years, I found I still love them. It doubt they're very healthy, but that's not the point, is it? Candy has no point, it is just to be enjoyed! :)",

But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag. I have also looked at green tea powder at places like Whole Foods and Asian super markets, and this is a really good deal in comparison. So buy some and enjoy!",

By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water. She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle!

It really pleased my teetotaler guests.<br /><br />If you're shopping for violet flavoring for baking, candy-making or flavoring ice cream, you should search for extract or concentrate. This product isn't designed for concentrated use. (If you DO get violet extract, you can make your own violet syrup. 1 part sugar, 1 part water. Heat over a low flame until the sugar is just dissolved, and you have simple syrup.

            "I am a BzzAgent and recently received a coupon for a free bag of Bil-Jac Dog Food to try.  I have a VERY active 8 year old Labrador Retriever who is pretty spastic at times.  After eating Bil-Jac Large Breed Select Adult for several days, her attention span and energy levels seemed to be more evened out and her bowel movements were more compact as well.  From a human standpoint, the food didn't have that nasty dog food smell, so from that alone it seems like the quality of the ingredients was much higher than most other dog foods out there.  We did a challenge to see if our dog liked Bil-Jac better than the dog food we usually buy for her by setting out two dog bowls of food to see which one she preferred.  She sniffed both bowls and went right for the Bil-Jac.  This is significant because we put her usual food in her bowl and the Bil-Jac in the bowl that we usually give to our other dog (we have a side by side double bowl feeder).  She skipped right past her bowl (which she never does) to eat the Bil-Jac.  The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because it is significantly higher in price than the dog food we usually buy (we have two large Labrador Retrievers to feed), so dog food costs a small fortune for us already.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Bil-Jac.",

This is a great tasting tea, very different flavor than just regular black tea, has real zing with the rose petals & safflower flavoring.  It's hard to explain how it tastes and some may not like it, but I got 3 bags so i won't run out.  It only takes about 1/2 tsp of this loose tea to make one nice cup.  You can put the loose tea in a round enclosed strainer & pour boiling water over it to steep, or put the loose tea straight into the tea pot & strain as you pour.  I usually mix the tea with a pinch of loose green tea.  If the flavor is too strong, you could mix with regular black tea, green tea, etc..  I really love it. Don't be put off by it's name. It's a nice foil package with paper lining inside the foil.  The only thing i'm disappointed with in these packages, that they didn't come with a resealer bendable thingy.  My other bag could be resealed each time, but these will need to be taped, or a large rubber band, clothes pin, etc... I can deal with that though. Love the tea!",

I was hoping the  nut  was a walnut, pecan, or almond (or all of the above!), but it's merely an unimpressive sliver of regular old peanut.

            "Due to our cooking habits we use a lot of avocados in preparing our meals.  From Mexican food to salads and sandwiches and of course Guacamole Dip, they are an important part of our dietary intake.  The Guacamole dip is a favorite in our household and my wife has at least six different recipes she prepares it with.  We do though use and try out various prepared mixes such as this McCormick brand...which by the way, is one of our favorites. This adds variety and we do love variety! I can tell you right now that if I were grading this product on quality and eating enjoyment I would give it five stars in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am giving this particular one a one star review and if it were possible, I would give it less.  Did you read the price on this thing!  I must tell you that the first reviewer here saved me a bunch of coin and a major temper meltdown.  Thank you Dutch for pointing the price of this product out to me.  I was actually ready to hit the purchase button on this one after I had added it to my shopping cart.  Thank goodness I had second thoughts and went back and read the review.  This product, when we purchase it at or local store cost around one dollar.  This is a somewhat reasonable price.  Did you realize that these folks are selling ONE PACKAGE (ONE OZ) for a total of $6.00!  Either this seller is trying a big time rip off or there has been a major typographical error here.  In either case there is NO WAY I am going to plunk out that much money for this stuff...as good as it is!<br /><br />Anyway, the mix itself is quite good.  We use a lot of McCormick products and have yet to find one we are dissatisfied with.  But the price here is absolutely outrageous to the point of being offensive.<br /><br />End of review but as long as we are talking about saving money.....<br /><br />Did you folks know you can freeze avocados?  Yup, for dip and spreads freezing these things works perfectly.  I am not sure how things are in your part of the country, but here in our little part of the world the price of avocados goes through wild fluctuations.  I have quite often seen them selling for $1.50 apiece!  No there is no way that I am going to pay that much for one of these things.  On the other hand, we often, for one reason or another, find these things relatively dirt cheap.  I just purchased a whole bunch of the things for .32 cents apiece.<br /><br />When we find these on sale like this be buy a great number of them.  We take them home, let them ripen to our taste, wash and dry them and then stick them in freezer bags...usually three our four or our family.  When we want to whip up a batch of dip or spread, we simply take them out of the freeze, let them thaw and we are in business.  After they have been frozen the skins simply slip right off and you can mush them up quite easily.  This dose not work if you like sliced avocados for salads or sandwiches as they are too soft and mushy. On the other hand, it makes great dip and spread.  We cannot tell the difference in the flavor of the frozen ones over the fresh.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks",

            "Let me first tell you that before I was turned on to Read Leaf Tea, I would sometimes put in some good quality caramel sauce into my matcha lattes as a treat - I really do love good caramel flavoring! Thanks to this company, I don't have to do that anymore - AND I can control the sugar amount!<br /><br />Upon pouring out the contents of the robustly-flavored Caramel Green Matcha from the non-resealable, gold foil packaging into the tin, I could smell the sweetness of caramel. I HAD to make a bowl right then and there!<br /><br />For this first preparation I sifted a teaspoon of matcha powder into my bowl - I highly recommend doing this! Without it, you risk the chance of having clumpy matcha, and no one wants that! I wisked in two ounces of warmed water with my electric frother until the matcha was fully dissolved. Filled the bowl with the rest of the warmed water, about 6 ounces worth.<br /><br />I found the caramel missing an element - maybe it's sweetness, which is something I usually associate with caramel. While Red Leaf Tea doesn't add any sugar to their matchas, I found this benefited from some added sweetener.<br /><br />I also think I might prefer the Caramel Matcha prepared as a sweeter latte - either hot or cold.<br /><br />I do look forward to playing around with the Caramel Matcha more - mixing it with other flavored matchas from this company. Caramel Cheesecake, Caramel Green Apple, Caramel Espresso, Caramel Vanilla, just to name a few! Oooo and I bet baking with this is going to be AMAZING!",

We also enjoy the Spice Hunter  Cowboy BBQ  blend, Hickory blend and Mesquite seasoning. These blends are excellent and will save you time when cooking.

            "After living in Okinawa for nearly 4 years, returning to the US was a bit of culture shock.  We had access to American grocery stores while there, but always bought our rice, fish and produce at the local markets.  I never saw this particular variety there, but I found it at a local grocery in Virginia and tried it.  The taste is far superior to plain old white varieties from the rice and grain aisle in the regular markets, which is not good enough for me anymore.  Even short grain rice, which is hard to find at the best of times, still lacks something.  Koshihikari has superior taste and texture to even medium grain rice that might bear the label 'sushi rice'.<br />Be sure to rinse several times till the water runs clear.  I cook mine in my Japanese rice cooker b/c I cannot trust myself to watch a pot on the stove.  Though my neighbors always told me, for authentic taste, cook it the old fashioned way: rinse well, soak for 15 minutes in measured water, then cook it in a cast iron pot on the stove top.  Let it set covered for 10-15 minutes to steam before serving.<br />This variety is darn near close to authentic Japanese rice, best I can tell without a side-by-side taste test.",

            "Glad to see someone decided to put GRANULAR Splenda in a larger package!<br /><br />The Splenda  in the bag  is DIFFERENT from that in packets!  It contains<br />maltodextrin -- as do the packets.....BUT NO DEXTROSE!  Dextrose, and sucralose, (the main ingredient), are both SUGARS...but Sucralose, of course, is sugar with a hydrogen atom changed for a carbon atom, (or some such thing)....and so a new, safer  sugar  results!  No  cloying  taste, when used to excess, as  real  sugar has.  So, sucraLOSE, though a sugar, is a sugar of  a different sort ...a safer sort, for diabetics and pre-diabetics.  Granular Splenda has ONLY Sucralose and Maltodextrin...whilst the PACKET variety ADDS the Dextrose....Another form of sugar which is NOT as safe, (for diabetics and pre-diabetics), as sucralose is!  (If you don't believe me that a different formula is in each variety, read the labels, as I did!)<br /><br />This said, I have heard my sister say that there is research that sucralose COULD lead to a shortening of  t  cells in the body...the cells that grow shorter, anyway, as we age.  So, imbibing sucralose -- in any form -- could shorten life...according to what my sister has heard and said, anyway.  How much it shortens life -- if at all -- is something I don't know.  What I DO know is that diabetes -- in any form -- can definitely shorten life, if not treated properly!  I'm a pre-diabetic -- who actually got Type II -- then lost it, (because I lost 30 pounds!)  This may not work for everyone...but it did work for me, so I pass the info on.  A quite thin friend of mine has Type II.  She also has a very negative attitude towards life.  Losing weight obviously will not help her.  Having a more optimistic, (yet still realistic) attitude will.  But it's hard to convince nt negatively-minded friend of this.  Hopefully, this advice of trying to be more positive -- and also losing weight, if possible -- can help others.  Nope -- life isn't perfect for anyone.  But if you sit down, and list the 10 best things in your life in one column, and the 10 worst things in another, you'll see how things balance out, and hopefully, get a more realistically-positive view on life!  Hopefully, too, this realistically-positive attitude -- combined with excercise and diet -- can help regulate...or, perhaps, eventually eliminate, any person's case of diabetes.  Certainly, excercise, good thoughts, losing weight, and correct diets, can't hurt.  Even using Splenda Granulated can't hurt -- too much -- if one cuts down, just a bit.<br /><br />All in all, Splenda Granuated is a great product, and I'm SO glad to see it is now in the  super-economy  size.  When I looked at the  5-pound equivalent bag , I noticed Amazon isn't sellong that any more.  But a notice that the larger-size bag IS being sold on Amazon, should be mentioned there!  Splenda Granulated, even if does break down T-cells (quickly or slowly...I don't know), is still a great product!  Use in moderation -- or as moderately as you can -- though!",
            "Heinz Yellow Mustard was a long search, but certainly worth it. I prefer Heinz over the leading competitor; however, here in lies the problem. I could not find it in any of the many grocery stores in my area, and believe me I went all over. Short of stealing a bottle from a local restaurant or two, I found it here on Amazon. Oh sure I had to buy a case of this tasty mustard, but it won't go bad while in storage.",

            "The first jar of these my Wife and I bought got inhaled by us the first day!<br />They are so flipping good you won't believe it.<br />They are just spicy enough, yet sweet and tangy, with perfect crunch and freshness.

Given that I am already familiar with these teas, I made this purchase because the product description included two teas that I had not tried.  I thought this was a new collection with a combination of new and old products.  Turns out that it was the same 'old' collection and despite what was in the product description, this collection did not include the two teas that I had not tried.  I thought it may have been a shipping problem because the two teas are also listed amongst the ingredients on the box.  Sale or no sale, I am making my tea purchases in a store so that I will know what is in the box.",
            "The extra fine grind of this flour and their brown rice flour allows cooks to create wonderfully textured baked goods.  When combined with other starch flours to make a flour blend, items bake up with a lovely crumb.  Guests don't even realize you're serving GF foods!",
            "This cereal is made with the following ingredients, per the listing on the box:  Whole wheat flour, raisins (raisins, vegetable glycerin, vegetable oil [canola and/or sunflower oil]), wheat bran, milled cane sugar, barley malt syrup, whole rolled oats, vegetable oil (canola and/or safflower and/or sunflower oil), rice flour, oat fiber, salt, honey, annatto (for color), turmeric (for color), mixed tocopherols (natural vitamin E to maintain freshness), cardamom seed, fennel seed, fenugreek seed, nutmeg. Contains wheat. Produced in a facility that processes tree nuts, wheat and soy. <br /><br />Each one-cup serving is 190 calories, about 80 calories more than Kellogg's Raisin Bran (KRB). It has more fat than KRB, but also more fiber and more protein. This bran cereal contains 2 g fat (18 calories), 44 g of carbohydrates (176 calories) of which 8 g is fiber. The fiber is equivalent to 32 calories, which are not digestible by the body and can effectively be subtracted from the 176 calories for carbs, bringing it down to 144 calories. It has 6 g protein (32 calories). That comes to a total calorie count of 194, which is very close to the 190 calories listed. The minimal difference is because carbs and protein are slightly less than 4 calories per gram, and fat is slightly less than 9 calories per gram.<br /><br />This cereal is described by the manufacturer as  whole grain oat clusters,  and given that the recipe for making them is different than Kellogg's Raisin Bran, it is not surprising that they don't taste the same as that product. However, in their own right they taste quite good.<br /><br />This product is not sugar-free, but it uses natural sweeteners which are slightly less unhealthy than the white sugar, brown sugar or high fructose corn syrup that KRB uses. These natural sweeteners consist of milled cane sugar, barley malt syrup, and honey. The milled cane sugar and barley malt syrup are vegan, by the way, but honey is not considered to be vegan, so it is too bad the manufacturer added it to this cereal, or they could have had another selling point. In terms of health, though, the truth is, all sweeteners which are either fructose or sucrose, which each of the sweeteners mentioned above are, raise blood glucose levels. The advantage for controlling blood-glucose spikes that this cereal offers over and beyond what KRB provides is more fiber, more protein and a little bit more fat, all of which act like anchors on blood glucose levels, lessening spikes of blood glucose due to the relatively large percentage of carbs that any breakfast cereal contains, no matter who makes it.<br /><br />A true advantage of this cereal over KRB is that it contains no artificial coloring, flavoring or preservatives. (Note that the KRB ingredient list does not admit to any coloring agents or preservatives, which I find very odd and very likely a dishonest omission--it's simply not possible that it has no preservatives in it of any kind to maintain freshness. Here are all the ingredients listed on the KRB box and on the Kellogg's website:  Whole grain wheat, raisins, wheat bran, sugar, brown sugar syrup, contains 2% or less of salt, malt flavor. )<br /><br />What this cereal has used to color, flavor and preserve its cereal are an impressive list of very healthy substances. Mixed tocopherols maintain freshness. This is the form of vitamin E that is best absorbed in the body. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that fights cancer and heart disease. Annatto and turmeric are used to color the cereal. Annatto is rich in antioxidants that function similarly to vitamin E, and turmeric is particularly well known for its anti-inflammatory properties. This cereal also contains cardamom seed, fennel seed, and fenugreek seed, all of which are strong aids to digestion. Studies on the action of fenugreek have also found it is helpful in controlling cholesterol and blood-sugar levels. Nutmeg has antibacterial action, in particular combating the bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition, nutmeg contains compounds protective of the heart and that help prevent Alzheimer's. It also tastes great and, much like cinnamon, when used in baked goods or cereals, can cause them to taste sweeter so that less sugar is needed.<br /><br />There is no mention of this product being organic, though the company makes this sales pitch:  By effectively combining the finest all natural ingredients, sustainable practices and regular giving to worthy causes, Peace Cereal truly delivers Peace of Mind in Every Bite! <br /><br />All in all, as high-carb cereals go, this one is a good bet. It is not safe for people with wheat or soy allergies, though, and diabetics would be better off eating a cereal with no sweetener of any kind and using a natural sweetener with no calories that does not raise the blood sugar like <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000Z9ASSK >stevia powder</a>.",

Second, the flavored varieties are not sugary-sweet as one has come to expect from instant flavored oatmeal, but are complex in flavor.

If you like the tart-sweet flavor profile, this is a thumbs up!",
            "The product arrrived in a timely fashion, properly packaged in appropriate ground coffee bags.  The coffee itself was good in a center of the road vein, neither too lacking in characteristics, nor excelling in any catagory.  I ended up mixing it with some Central and South American coffees.

I'm not a health freak or anything, but that stuff is really, really bad for you.  If you don't care about such things, then go for it.  They are awesome and fun.",

            "Provided the mix is fresh, this is the best mix ever.  Easy, consistenly delicious waffles everytime.  The best thing is they don't have that baking powder taste of most mixes.  I have got my parents and inlaws hooked to it as well.  I warn you this stuff is addictive.<br /><br />My recommendation is to get yourself a decent not to expensive Waring waffle iron (the type that flips them) then you will have nice light, yet crispy delights.  You will not be sorry, do it, you will love it.<br /><br />My only downside here is that there are not too many blueberries, but enough. The blueberries are dehydrated, so they will not be as good as fresh (but you don't get the thermal bomb effect when you eat them). To make the most of the berries I recommend you let the mix sit for 10 minutes after you mix it for proper hydration. You will probably want to serve thse with fresh berries for the best experience.  They are also great with pure maple syrup.",

It is gluten-free, is easy to make and is tasty. My daughter (who is 4) loved it and she is a super picky eater. To find something quick for her to make, that is confirmed gluten-free (she has celiac), and that she likes is truly a relief for me. I bought them to test to see if she would eat them. I got this Peanut flavor and the Pad Thai. I sort of liked the Pad Thai better, but both were yummy (the Green Curry was too spicy for me). The portion is just right for one person.

            "I received the green pouches as illustrated, and the price for a full pound of tea was very attractive. The Amazon listing currently (Sept. 2011) describes this Assam tea as organic. Nothing on the package indicates this is so. However, the company's website states that this and nearly all of their teas are USDA Certified Organic.<br /><br />I have been drinking tea for some decades, and keeping notes to remind myself of favorites. I expect a quality Assam tea to have an appealing aroma and a complex flavor with hints of malt. This product failed to deliver. This Two Leaves & A Bud product is flat and uninteresting. It has little aroma and has little taste at all. The package I received was probably old inventory, long past its peak. Older tea does not go rancid; packaged tea simply looses its aroma and flavor as it ages.<br /><br />This Assam tea had mostly whole leaves, not the smaller fannings or dust-like particles you sometimes find in bargain-basement teas. You can add boiling water and infuse up to 3.5 or 4 minutes without causing excessive bitterness, but you get very little of the classic Assam flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: Bland, with little flavor or aroma. I might buy another tea from this brand, but only if I knew that it was fresh inventory ... and that it had received good reviews.<br /><br />Options: As an alternative for bargain hunters, Ahmad brand Kalami Assam tea can be purchased for about $10/pound in South Asian and Middle Eastern grocery stores. This inexpensive Ahmad tea is not great, but it is more appealing than this tea. Of the more upscale packaged brands, I recommend the Assam offerings from Peet's, especially their Assam Extra Fancy. I wish you fun and good luck in your tea tasting.",

Also, when you buy in bulk like this you save close to a dollar a can compared to what my local supermarket charges for these.  It's not worth the price that way.  It's just barely worth it to me at the usual price (in bulk) that Amazon sells it for. Health Valley should lower the price just a bit or add more noodles and vegetables in the can.

Secondly, there is supposed to be a packet of yeast  in the box  but there was not a single packet of yeast in any of the four packages that comprised the order.  I called the company just to make sure that the yeast was not included in the mix itself and the  in the box  was a printing error but the Mama Leone's representative I spoke with assured me that a seperate packet of yeast should have been included in each box of bread mix.  The representative was also quick to say that four packets of yeast  ...will be immediately shipped to you to make up for what you had to buy in order to make the bread .  Well.....it's been almost THREE months since shipment was promised and I have yet to see any yeast packets.  Don't think this small firm located in a comprably small town near Tulsa OK can afford to incur the displeasure of amazon.com customers since it would be my guess they may sell a number of their mixes over amazon's web site.  The missing yeast is a relatively small thing to me personally but the untruth regarding sending replacement yeast packets is not.  Poor business acumen is exhibited when a company can't be truthful in its' business dealings with customers.  Forget this one and save your money.  The mix doesn't taste as it is reported to taste and you may or may not have to buy your own yeast before you can even mix or bake the bread!",

It has no fat, no calories, less than 1 gram of sugar (which is, of course, next to nothing), and it has almost no carbohydrates, either.<br /><br />I usually prefer Sweet And Low for my sweetener; but when I can't get my hands on that Equal is a fairly good substitute. Equal is my second choice because it's not quite as sweet as Sweet And Low. On the other hand, if you prefer a non-sugar sweetener that's not too sweet or potent, then Equal would be a good choice for you.<br /><br />Equal is a powdery white substance. Just open the individual packet or packets and pour it in to your beverage. It is probably quite good for certain recipes as well. Keep the individual packets in the box they come in or you can put them into any container you wish.<br /><br />Just one warning: This product contains phenylalanine. If you are allergic to that or if phenylalanine makes you ill in any way I would definitely avoid this product.<br /><br />Overall, Equal is a good choice for a sweetener substitute for sugar. It isn't quite as potent as Sweet And Low; that can be a good or bad thing depending on how sweet you like your beverages or recipes. I myself prefer the taste of Sweet And Low. Of course, you can always add a little more Equal to make the drink a bit sweeter.<br /><br />Four stars.",

It's 3:00am and the guilt from watching the last P90X infomercial while eating ice cream had just worn off.  Suddenly as if Billy Maze himself had yelled it through my TV - I got the craving for some Peanut Brittle.<br /><br />Not being one who needs instant gratification I turned to my old friends at Amazon. I figured ... If I were to order food, sight unseen ... peanut brittle in fact, it seems reasonable to order form a company called THE PEANUT COMPANY of Virginia.<br /><br />Well - The items arrives well wrapped and protected from Amazon with no visible damage to the outside of the box. The contents however were a different story.<br /><br />Which is kind of the disappointment here. The brittle arrived in such small pieces that a lot of it being simply brittle dust. On what pieces were not completely incinerated you were lucky to have maybe 1-2 actual peanuts, These were caramelized and stale like the rest of the product reminiscent of something your grandmother put out  when surprised by an unexpected distant relative.<br /><br />Now it is possible - that The Peanut Company of Virginias has one employee who suffers from an extreme peanut allergy as to only be able to toss in 11 peanuts into the brittle mix before having to run for their inhaler and in running coincidentally tripped and crushed the box of brittle... and in his dismay, hid the box for 4 years in shame before it was accidentally found and used to fulfill my order. But ...there is also the possibility, that if you like real peanut brittle your better off buying from a store where you can see the product first. See my pic<br /><br />Good Chomping :-)",

As far as the mint filling, it adds some more sweetness to the Chocolate, but at the same time the mint is very refreshing. Perfect to have after dinner or as dessert.<br /><br />If you like Mint Chocolate, you might also want to try the After Eight Mint Chocolate. they are very good too. Also try the Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Chocolate which is kind of interesting taste (a combination of chocolate/dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust).",

This product (both the cherries and the blueberries) marked the very first instance where I  bought a dried fruit product online, and was not disappointed.<br /><br />The cherries are all evenly ripe, tart, plump, deeply flavorful, and only lightly sweetened.  They also have a very light coating of oil to seal in their moisture, and prevent clumping.  They're perfect for snacking, and wonderful in oatmeal, muffins and scones.  I've also minced them into sauces, stir fry, and salads, muddled them into lemonade (imparting a pink color and a fruity note), and I also plan to use a few of them to add a subtle nuance to an upcoming homemade mead and a cherry-infused liqueur.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this product, and given that I own a vaccum sealer and plenty of glass jars with universal lids, they should have an excellent shelf life.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",

            "I absolutely love any kind of chocolate, and I have tried so many different kinds.  However, I have to say, that this Ferrero Collection ranks somewhere near the top of all of the many chocolates I have eaten; yes, it's that good.<br /><br />There are 24 chocolates in the container made up of 8 chocolates of each of the 3 different varieties.  The first kind is the Rocher, which is a chocolate wafer covering some delicious chocolate cream filling which is then covering a hazelnut.  This is my least favorite (mostly because of the fact that I'm not a huge fan of hazelnuts), but it is still very tasty indeed.  The second variety included in this collection is the Garden, which happens to be the favorite of my family and me!  It is another wafer topped with coconut flakes; this wafer then covers a divine coconut filling that is supposed to cover an almond, but to be honest, I never tasted the almond.  The final chocolate that composes the collection is the Rondnoir, a chocolate wafer covering a chocolate cream filling which is covering a dark chocolate  pearl  or ball.  This will be the favorite of those who love just pure chocolate delight, although everyone else will probably devour it, too.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with this collection!  It is amazingly delectable and is a fantastic gift for any chocolate lover.  I recommend it for parties, gifts, or really for anything where people will be eating.  It is an awesome collection that will have your taste buds tingling in delight the moment you taste your first chocolate!",

It's $3.99 each at the grocery store, and almost $5 a bottle here.  Why or why must it be so expensive?  I'm trying to drink this instead of Dt. Coke but the cost makes me think twice.

Our dog is allergic to something in even the highest quality foods--we think it might be beef or chicken, but we're not 100% sure.  Either way, his constant itching and biting his feet cleared up within two weeks when we switched to the California Natural Lamb and Rice.  I wanted to have another option to switch it up with, so we tried the herring flavor.  Still great for his allergies, but I think I know why it's not carried in our local pet store: it STINKS.  I don't know why I wasn't expecting that... it's made with fish, after all!  But our dog loves it and it will make a nice change when we want to switch it up.  I highly recommend trying the California Natural foods before trying any expensive allergy medications or  prescription  foods from the vet.",
            "I have to admit I was somewhat skeptical in deciding to purchase a bread mix brand that in all honesty I had never heard of.  However, after baking my first loaf in my automatic bread machine, I was shocked to find that the bread is as soft and light as a cloud! The outer crust maintains a perfect crispiness even though the inside remains airy days after baking, assuming your family hasn't gobbled it up by then! And the fresh bread aroma filling the house as it bakes is better than any of the plug-in air fresheners that we're all guilty of buying, especially when you add cinnamon to the mix! I've only tried the white mix thus far (best if adding spices to the baking cycles) so I can't address the other varieties but have to assume they're equally tasty and aromatic.  I have baked additional loaves for family and friends and they love it too! Looking forward to receiving future shipments of this  Slice of Heaven. ",

The whole grain formula is smaller hard round nuggets, so she doesn't like them, but other cats may like it.  I feel it is a healthy cat food for her and since she has been eating it for awhile now, she doesn't have the fur balls so much like she used to.

I'm in a rural area and it's a long trip to the store so we go about once a month and having this deal meant I didn't have to look at several stores to find the best price. However, over 4 bucks a box is no deal. I gave this 5 stars because I like Raisin Bran; I could not see where it was made so no complaints about Mexico, the use by dates are mid-2013; the price was right and I was a happy camper. I would not purchase this again at this price for any reasons that I can possibly fathom. As a side note, check prices carefully in the food stores because I find that the larger boxes are often more per ounce than the smaller boxes and at one store the store brand in a bag was more per ounce than the Kellogg's.",

The smell is overpowering on the butter and not real butter but fake butter.  Not sure what it would have been like if I used oil instead of margarine. I think it was the fake butter that made the mix bad.  I love Pillsbury but this version is terrible.  Bought it by accident.  Hope that doesn't happen again.",

I used the powdered milk in my homemade bread and sometimes the granules wouldn't dissolve.  Nido is a fine powder and dissolves instantly. It works great in bread and other baking,plus it works great as an instant milk for regular drinking. I also like the fact that now the Nido from Holland is available. I use to buy the Nido from Mexico in my local supermarket, but it has not been available for almost a year now.  If you don't like powdered milk, try this one, I think you will be impressed.",

Plus, it has a nice minty aftertaste that lingered in my mouth, and (I am reliably informed) kept my breath sweet.<br /><br />Now, just because these mints are  sugar free  that doesn't mean that they are zero calories. In fact, each one has five calories (carbs 2g.), which is not bad for a large mint (the size of a Life Savers candy, as apposed to these tiny, tiny mints).<br /><br />I really like these mints, and will definitely be buying more!",

I found its potency to be very weak. To get the sweetness I like, I have to use about 4 times the amount of my favorite stevia, and then the aftertaste becomes too bitter. The stevia extract that I really like begins with a K. It may seem pricey, but you will need MUCH less and it will have a much better aftertaste.

I decided to pick up some of this flour and use it to see how baking some of our favorite recipes would turn out.<br /><br />The flour works well as a GF substitute for regular baking flour.  I've used it in many recipes and have been happy with the results.  As is typical for GF cooking, there's a little less of a rise in the cooking process.  I'll upload a picture from a recent Pineapple Upside down cake we cooked in a 12  Dutch oven that turned out really great as a GF desert.<br /><br />5 stars, we love having a GF flour to cook and bake with.",

            "Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).

We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0002DGRSY >Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.",

            "I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with  filler  in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.",

Yes, the price is high for gum, but I was willing to pay a higher price to get something I desired and it was worth the cost.",

I am able to make very large cups of tea and still have the strong cinnamon flavor.  I am planning on ordering other versions of Davidson's chai teas to see if the flavor is any different.

I have found only 2 dry foods he will eat (Science Diet and now Bench & Fields Holistic Brand) and in his 8 years I have tried every organic cat treat I could find.  He used to love the Bench & Fields Cat Treats until they changed the formula about three or so years back and he won't touch them.<br /><br />I stumbled upon these Bonita Tuna Flakes while browsing Amazon and saw great comments and bought a small pouch to give it a try.  I put a pinch down in front of my cat and he gave me a look like  What the heck is this?   I was bummed to think there is yet another treat he won't touch.  But after he sniffed it and looked at it for a few minutes, he finally gave it a try.  That was it.  He is INSANE for this stuff.  I give it to him around the same time every day and he starts pacing and giving me this pathetic meow like he is dying every evening until I declare  Time for treats!  and it is all I can do to get the container open and pull out a pinch, because he is literally shaking in excitement to get his  fix. <br /><br />I like this brand in the big plastic container, because I don't have to reorder so much and I can always have an extra container on standby so I don't run out.  It's a little pricey, but for me it is totally worth it, since I have had no luck with any other cat treats before.  And I can't foresee any issue of a  change of formula  happening like with Bench & Fields.  These are flakes of tuna and should always be the same.  So now I have a treat that my cat will enjoy for the rest of his pampered finicky life.",

After xrays, and sedatives, enemas and iv fluids and blood tests, the vet removed 9 pellets, found a raging UTI and his kidney values are through the roof!  I called the manufacturer to find out what was in the pellets and was told: zeolite, silica, cement, and polysomethingorother.<br />Their website does not tell you that, just says no problem if your cat ingest - it'll will pass thru.  Not so!  I already have a vet bill in excess of $500 it is climbing because they have to keep him there!!<br />Update September 15, 2008<br />Vet bill in excess of $1000, kidney failure and Freddie died on Saturday, September 13, 2008.",

The other order came in good time.  It took the coffee close to a month before it arrived.  It tasted like it'd been sitting in a warehouse the whole time; definitely not fresh.  The roast was also not dark enough for espresso.  Poor delivery, poor product.  This was not my usual Amazon experience.",

After scouring the shelves at the local oriental markets this is the only canned sauce I found that doesn't have MSG. It doesn't have the intense flavor of the fresh curry paste, but it will do in a pinch. Note: it's not too spicy; just right for me and I usually order mild at a Thai restaurant.",

Maybe I added too much water because there wasn't any extreme salty taste.  It would be a good soup for the miso-phobe to try.",
            "We decided to purchase Weber N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning because we figured if it boasted the New Orleans name, it had to be good stuff.  But, we were slightly let down by the overall spiciness of this seasoning.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I just used a little on the fish I made.  This was because in the past, some Cajun flavored foods were very spicy, and when I smelled the spice after opening it, it smelled strong.  But as we ate the fish, we could barley taste the Cajun!<br /><br />This spice is good for those who don't want an overpowering or highly spicy Cajun flavoring.  Sometimes I myself like that, but if I'm using Cajun, I usually want it to be bold.<br /><br />Add a little extra paprika alongside this seasoning and it greatly enhances it.<br /><br />Overall it isn't terrible, but it isn't as bold as one might expect from a N'Orleans Cajun.",

The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged, so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer, and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen. The chicken itself was OK.",

Not the best price out there but the mini packs are useful for kid snacks.<br /><br />The pricing math is just relevant because these are my favourite gummies EVER and they are best shopped for at a per-piece cost since they are kind of expensive and can be bought in several different package types.",

I like the variety of flavors these bars come in and the convenience. The high protein makes it a good snack to tide me over until I can eat a meal. But it takes me 45 minutes to eat an entire bar because it is so sweet. I think I will stick to more natural snacks. I would buy these again though if they were on sale.

Eventually, we lost our older dog, and now the younger one is an old lady. We have switched from the weight control to regular, particularly since she has recently lost 30% of her body weight.<br /><br />In the meantime, we have added a younger chihuahua to the mix, and she enjoyed both the weight control and the regular.<br /><br />While some of the ingredients (like beef tallow and chicken by products) sound gross to me, I have to remember I am not a dog, and living in a rural area, I have seen what they think is appetizing.

            "The GOOD news is that this Comstock Apple pie filling has 60% fewer calories than Comstock's regular apple filling and it's really tasty.  1/3 of a cup has only 35 calories so that this would make a good pie for the holidays for people on a diet.  Sweetened with Sucralose (i.e. Splenda) it's made with one of the healthier artificial sweetners.<br /><br />The Bad news -- at least for moms like me -- is that there aren't any vitamins in this pie mixture.  0% Vitamins A and C.  Zero percent% Calcium and iron.<br /><br />Now, glancing over some health sites on the internet I find that what you can expect from a 'freshly' made apple pie is something like 2-to-4% of daily requirements of Vitamin A per slice, and 4-to-6% Vitamin C; and 4-to-10% of daily Iron.  So something is lost in the processing of this product.  Something that I was hoping to fill my family with... good nutrition.<br /><br />This is important for me because I have one of those kids who disparages fruits and veggies, but who will eat pie.  It's for him and his sister that I bake pies.  If there's no vitamins there doesn't seem to be a point in making them.  I could easily buy cookies which don't require preparation.<br /><br />SUMMARY::<br />I won't be buying this mix again.  At least not until the kids go off to college.  At that point I might make it for my husband and myself on the rare occasion, as the lower calorie count and lack of sugar makes this pie filling very attractive for us.",

            "I was hunting for Gen Mai Cha when I stumbled upon another tea made buy the same manufacturer. I never had Hoji tea before. I knew from reviews of it that it was a golden colored tea. That it is. It was a blend of some odd stuff to me but that is the nature of tea blends. Hoji tea has a very unique flavor I never had before. Now the Genmai Cha made by SA is off the hook. This tea likewise is an excellent compliment for some meals. I would find it a prefect counterbalance to Teriyaki dishes. I would even drink this while eating tempura. It has a strange smoky woody taste. It is not bitter at all either like conventional tea can be. Some people say it has a seaweed like smell to it but this brand has a smell that reminds me of a field that has been burned and tilled for the next season's planting. It is not a smokey smell per say but a earthy smell. There is no chlorophyll like tinge of a cut grass field to this tea. This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I can say for myself this is another very high quality product. It is not as expensive as Gen Mai but for those needing something different tea wise I would recommend giving this a spin! If other Hoji teas let you down this one will not!<br /><br />This was a remarkable introduction to Hoji tea for me! I think a lesser product would have not done it for me!",

            "I bought this at my local Safeway and the Thyme is so good and fresh and just extraordinarily special, that I am here looking for a better price so I can buy more.  Most dried herbs from the grocery store and even our local health food, organic store where you can buy in bulk,  have an off flavor that only faintly resembles the fresh.  This, on the other hand, is just superb.  It has a lovely fragrance and gives an incredible fresh thyme flavor to soups and other foods.<br /><br />I am going to spend the money and start buying Morton and Bassett herbs and spices.  I already love their peppercorns and now the thyme is just exceptional.  I have to try more of them.<br /><br />Buy this.  You will not be sorry.",
            "It's best to allow this caramel to melt in your mouth, but I can't help chewing it and then in moments, it's gone.  That's why I can eat a whole package (12 or so) in a day.  So creamy, so sweet, so rich.  Morinaga's milk caramel is so much better than Brach's.  I used to eat this as a child when my mother would buy it for me from Asian supermarkets and now I have discovered it here at Amazon.com.  It usually retails for $1.99 at the supermarket, but I've seen it for as much as $2.89 as well.  Yum! Yum! Yum!",

            "We have gradually changed over to using olive oil in almost all of our cooking. We like the taste of it and the health arguments are convincing to us. We now haven't used any oil other than olive oil in the last three years.<br /><br />One convenient item that has helped our conversion is the availability of cans of olive oil spray. We give our pans a light coating for frying eggs and other things and we lightly spray salads with it. It's about the same as using regular Pam, except that the sprayed ingredient is Extra Virgin Olive Oil. We're very satisfied with this product and it's very convenient.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",
            "We bought this food for our 2 year old Siamese cat after he started having problems with vomiting after eating too fast. The food is designed to encourage chewing so they don't eat so fast (common Siamese problem).  It helped significantly with the vomiting, but even with feeding him the  overweight  amount per day, he was still not losing any weight (he weighted 17.5 lbs at his weight in and has a bit of a waddle).  We have now switched him to the Royal Canin Light 40 and he is doing well.  He seems to have a little more energy than normal and loves the food. I was concerned that the smaller pieces would cause the vomiting to reappear, but he hasn't had one problem yet.  Overall the Royal Canin brand is great and I would recommend it to anyone.",

One wonders if it is 6 oz, 9 oz perhaps 15 oz (fast becoming the  supermarket pound ) or even 16 oz.  But the scant information supplied does not tell the interested buyer this crucial fact.

When I received the Jujubes they were 1.5 oz boxes instead if the 6.5 oz.  So I paid the same price for the 1.5 oz boxes as I would have paid for the 6.5 oz sized boxes.  The product was totally misrepresented by the vendor.  I would not have ordered this product had I known the  real  quantity size.<br /><br />I decided not to return the candy because it was just too much trouble to do so.  The main thing I wanted to do is let you know how the vendor misrepresented their product.<br /><br />I have ordered so much from Amazon and this is the very first time anything like this has ever happened and I was really disappointed.",

Have tried using other mixes and recipes for stove top but there's just something about the taste of this chilli- from a packet no less- that lingers in the memory.<br /><br />Bought this bulk pack from Amazon because the stores around me seem to charge a much higher price than they should for thsi product. Maybe the word is out and there are people like me that really enjoy the simplicity and ease of preparation of this dish. Recipe hint: the packet calls for two cans of red chilli beans, for variety try a can of light red and dark red or a can of red with a can of white. It's almost impossible to hurt the base flavor of this tasty chilli.",

            "I discovered these little peanut butter chips at a health food store in New Orleans and instantly loved them. They are great as a dessert topping, individually as a little snack, or even, blended with tofu and made into a  mousse  or pie filling!<br /><br />While these may not be the healthiest food in the world, they are certainly a somewhat healthier version.<br /><br />SELLER NOTE: In my experience, Vitacost is a great seller and their shipping is calculated on a per-order basis, not a per-item basis (I did not realize that, the first time I found these and was hesitant to purchase them because of the shipping cost). I bought a few bags of these and several other items and even got free shipping!<br /><br />I rely on Amazon to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you in the same manner.",

The only weird thing about this product is that it comes with 5 slices.  The slices are large enough to cut in half and make a sandwich with just one piece of bread, though.  They are double the size of what you get from other GF brands.  Most GF crusts are dry and have a distinct, icky flavor but this one doesn't.  Just really good bread!",

            "I have been eating Hampton Farms Cajun Creole Hot Nuts for about 15 years. In my opinion they are the most delicious snack food on the market. Healthy and tasty, but if they were unhealthy I would still eat 'em. I must confess, I am completely addicted. After you eat a few your nose starts to run and your eyes begin to water. For an extra added kick you can lick the shell (which has the hot Cajun flavor) after you eat the nuts inside. In fact, I am eating some right now and my mouth is on fire. Trust me, this is the good stuff.",

            "I like these bars and don't think that the molasses flavor is too heavy. Sesame seeds are relatively mild in flavor, but the combination of molasses and sesame is pretty good. Each package contains three flat sticks (sort of like oversized sticks of gum). An entire package is about 270 calories; however, it's possible to eat just a portion and put the rest into a plastic bag for later. The sesame seeds are calorie-dense foods and the molasses adds some iron to the nutrition mix. These keep pretty well and are good for travel, hiking, or just taking to work. The downside is that the bars do break easily so they tend to get messy. On one hand, that's good if you just want to eat a small piece; on the other hand, you probably won't receive too many unbroken ones in the box.",
            "I give this product two stars because there are no artificial ingredients and it is 75% organic. That is all it has going for it.<br />I'm trying to go  all natural  and  organic  with all my purchases. I saw this for about $5 for the five pack and since the price was comparable to the Velveeta version (which is far from  all natural ) I bought it.<br />Stirring the cheese sauce into the leftover water from cooking the macaroni took a few minutes. I did not time it, but it was more than two minutes. My son would not eat it. I made myself a package. It tastes kind of like macaroni with Cheetos powder on it (although I think Cheetos powder would taste better). I wound up melting a piece of organic American Cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable.<br />I think I'm going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese.<br />This product was a big fail in my household.<br />This is the first Annie's product that I have tried that I did not like.

But I am appalled by this stupid trick to fake a discount:<br /><br />You offer a simple product for a moon price and then generously offer a discount of 99%. That way you are constantly in the 70% off or more section. People who will look there out of curiousity (like me, today) will find that and be impressed. Well, but how stupid must one be not to realize what is going on?<br /><br />The same goes for the baker who offered 2 breads for 557$. Yes, five hundred fifty seven. For two breads. Yes, really, two breads. Also here in this section.<br /><br />The bread might be wonderful, and so might this tea really be great (I don't know that), but just for this one reason I will never order it, and I urge you not to order it either.

In fact, the cheap grocery store bouillon seems nothing more than a flavored salt cubes.<br /><br />This bouillon is quite different, with only 130 mg (5% DV) per serving (serving size is 1/2 a cube). And to be honest with you, I can't imagine wanting it any saltier. These cubes are bursting with great veggie flavor. Also, these are ideal for low-sodium diets and those who try to limit sodium intake.<br /><br />Four stars because, as another reviewer noted, the cubes don't dissolve as easily as other bouillon. You've really got to boil one on the stove top for best results if you want to make a drink out of it. The extra effort really is worth it, though, in the end.",
            "I tried this product on a whim, having remembered ages ago buying Kinder eggs and other Kinder products in Canada and enjoying them.  This is an excellent product, the hazelnut filling is very good, and the wafers quite crisp.  The outer chocolate coating is tasty as well.  I wish American mass produced chocolate was of this quality.<br /><br />The chocolate did come melted, but the product description does warn that one should refridgerate it upon delivery for an hour.  When I did so, it was fine and was still quite fresh and tasty.  Considering I ordered it in early July it's not exactly unexpected for it to come melted no matter how quickly they ship.

Not a problem as long as your roaster can handle it. I didn't experience any burned beans.<br /><br />I gave it a full roast and the results were quite good: full-bodied, well-balanced complex flavors.

The best way to prevent a picky eater in the toddler years is to give a wide variety of flavors and textures when they're still babies.

Zipfizz is this powered like drink (almost like kool aid). They also come in about 2  tubes, which then you pour into about 16-20 oz. of water. Shake. They also have Zipfizz in many different flavors- Grape, Berry, Orange soda, etc.<br /><br />  What i enjoy most about it is how easy and how fast it takes to make it. Its super fast, it only takes you 1 minute to make the drink. But the thing I don't like about it is, is when you go to shake it. It can explode on you. It's a negative and positive, drink but mostly positive.<br /><br />  I drink one almost everyday. I've also have showed it to many of my friends and they feel in love with the drink. Another thing is, is that it is more than 50% healthy and you can drink more than 3 times a day. Unlike Monsters or Amps. This Zipfizz actually works with energy. It last up to 5-7 hours!<br /><br />  People who wouldn't like Zipfizz would be optional, because everyone is different with the flavors they like.Zipfizz is every cheap to. it's $2 per. tube and or buy a case with 20 tubes for $10, when you purchase the drink.<br /><br />  I don't like Zipfizz, i love it. I also suggest to get the Orange flavor or the new flavors Creamsicle. They are very flavorful. And they are the one that don't explode on you when you're making them.",

So good I had to write this review, finding it difficult because the tears of joy streaming down my face.  I think I'm suffering from my own kind of PTSD (Product Tested: Super Delicious!!!).  Truly a great, great flavor and consistency with these.",

            "This was the first loose leaf tea I ever tried, the directions said a teaspoon for the cup and one for the pot, it may be too much.  A teaspoon of this tea expands to about a quarter of a cup of leaf.  I really enjoyed this and for my two teaspoons made about six cups of tea.  The tea has a nice flavor that I usually do not locate in green teas.  It has as described earlier a smoky quality to it that gives your mouth a taste of the green tea that lasts but doesn't disturb.  I have enjoyed using this in my teapot and adding water through the day until I wear the leaves thin.  If you like green tea try this.  I enjoy it with honey and milk.",

            "Cornstarch is cornstarch - what can one say?  I do like this brand because the packaging fits in with my other Bob's Red Mill gluten-free flours and starches on my pantry shelves, and the relatively wide mouth of the bag makes it easier to measure in the quantities I use in gluten-free baking than the boxes in which cornstarch is normally sold in grocery stores.",

In the absence of the Lite version, I got this one. The price is very good compared to what I paid in London. The taste is as good, but I noticed it requires more of the powder to achieve the flavor I want. But I'm not complaining. At this price I was able to buy 2 large ones. So, I'm happy. Now, if only they had the lite one I'd order it, because I feel quite guilty having this hi-calorie drink right before going to sleep. Aside from that, it is quite a treat to have. Certainly a comfort drink before going to sleep.",

            "I received this as a gift; bought mostly for the packaging, I suppose. There is no mention of the type of tea anywhere on the box other than  afternoon tea  -- usually, tea is identified by type (orange pekoe, ceylon black tea, etc.). I even went to the company website to find info on the tea, but only found pictures of the assortment of  Keep Calm and Carry On  and  The Queen's Diamond Jubilee  products they carry, with no descriptions available.The bags were cheap and had no string. I made myself a cup of tea, and found it to be pretty bitter. Save yourself the trouble of throwing this out; if you like the theme, buy a poster, tshirt, or something useful with your money, because for any regular tea drinker, this stuff is no good.",
            "I have always loved this Nestle Cream ever since I was a child in England, especially over canned peaches...mmmmm.  When I moved to the US in 1979, I could not find it anywhere.  Eventually, Walmart & Kroger's started selling it a few years back but lately it hasn't been as readily available through them. But then I decided to look for it on Amazon and I was elated. However, on this particular occasion when I bought this item, I was actually sent LE LECHERA (which is more like condensed milk) instead of the TABLE CREAM which is what I actually wanted.  My review is about the product so that is why I gave 5-Stars and also because Amazon was very swift in processing my refund for the incorrect product that was sent to me.",

            "Normally when I buy loose tea it is to save money because you need less.  Not the case here.  It took quite a bit more tea than recommended on the tin to get tea with any taste.  It took much more, by weight, to get tea the same strength as bags.  The taste was fine, nothing to applaud, nothing to boo.<br /><br />It looks like the labels will come off the tins so they can be re-used.  Organic gardeners will get more compost material than usual for tea.",

            "I made the mistake of purchasing this bag on Amazon's  Subscribe and Save  deal, figuring it would be a good deal. Lesson learned. No returns allowed on  Subscribe and Save;  I learned that important point after the product arrived.<br /><br />The garbanzo beans were filled with bug holes and many of them are eaten away by beetles or whatever species of insect they are, still crawling in the plastic bag. How can someone clear this product for sale? Thee bug holes are clearly visible through the clear plastic bag and there is a pile of bug eggs/larvae/garbanzo dust at the bottom of the bag. Very disappointed. As if the bug infestation wasn't bad enough, many of the beans are also shriveled, meaning they won't re-hydrate properly. The beans also have a generally unfresh odor, as if they were sitting on a warehouse floor for months (which they probably were).<br /><br />I will not be purchasing any products from TASTE Specialty Foods again.

            "I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)",

            "I want to say up front that I hate the taste of stevia. I tried it years ago when it first became the natural sweetener to try. I gagged. I tried it again in its updated  better  offerings. Still don't like it. Not even the popular Truvia could win me over.<br /><br />But it's getting to be summer, and though I mostly drink water/coffee/tea/coconut milk, I wanted a nice summery change of taste without calories or sugar or aspartame. So, yeah, I tried this.<br /><br />I decided to check out the grape first, as that one got consistently good reviews in the websites/blogs I visited to see what folks are saying. I got it today.<br /><br />I'm drinking it now WARM (arrived at my Miami doorstep 15 mins ago, so imagine it's not anywhere near cool here). I figured I'd taste it and, if I didn't like it, not bother to have it take up precious space in my crowded-with-produce fridge. I had a worry that my stevia-repulsed tastebuds would yell, yet again.<br /><br />Well, blow me down with a carbonated breath! This is GOOD! So good, I decided to come on and review it positively.<br /><br />I'm guessing the major lifting work of sweetening is being done by the erythritol (which I've had in stuff before and never bothered me, though I did sense the cooling effect). That's fine by me. I don't get weird rumbly tums from erythritol, and it's never had any funky effect on me like some report with aspartame.<br /><br />So, hey, I have a summer soda pop! I'm gonna order a six-pack of various other flavors to see if they measure up. The grape definitely measures up. And I'm even enjoying it WARM. :) I can't wait to see how it is fully chilled.<br /><br />And I appreciate that it doesn't have weird purple coloring. It's a clear fizzy liquid in my cup. I hate weird colored sodas.<br /><br />Thanks, Zevia. Nice grapey treat.",

Yea right, I am eating it right now and between 5-minute spoonfulls my face is melting!

I opened one bag and sampled it, hoping against hope that I didn't just waste my money.  The popcorn was stuck together, chewy and had a funny after taste.  I didn't bother to open the other packets. Just touching each one told me the other bags were in the same condition.  I would have been better off going to a department store and buying last years tin can of caramel corn.  I threw the rest away, fearful if I returned it, it would only get sold to some other unsuspecting soul.  Steer clear of this vendor.",

            "Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make  ladybug spots and antennae,  which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug  heads ) very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.",

            "Ritz crackers by Nabisco have always been one of my favorites. I remember eating them in kindergarten at snack time--I always wanted a couple extra! These crackers have stood the test of time because they are very tasty and great to eat as a snack.<br /><br />Ritz crackers are rather low in fat (4.5 grams of fat per serving) and they have almost no carbohydrates. They are cholesterol free as well--hooray! In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you. The nutrition label indicates that there are no trans-fats but I did notice a bit of partially hydrogenated ingredients on the label--it may be that the amount of trans-fats this generates is negligible.<br /><br />Ritz crackers can be eaten by themselves but feel free to get creative! They can help out when it's time to make snacks for company. Just put a bit of cheese (or melted cheese and ham) on them and you're serving up great appetizers or snack in no time! They go great with a little bit of butter on them, too.<br /><br />Overall, Ritz crackers really hit the spot when I crave a snack before bedtime. I simply take a slice of two of regular cheese and place little bits of the cheese on top of the crackers and with a small beverage it's awesome!<br /><br />I highly recommend Ritz crackers as one of the healthier crackers that will satisfy you, too.

My final verdict is that they are delicious. The only candy shop in my city that has jordan almonds available in blue, as opposed to a mix of colors, is charging $12.99/lb.

However, the amazon delivery on these suck. Most of the time they are unavailable and when they are available, the shipping takes forever to deliver them. For that reason, I have to take away 2 stars. For product itself, I will give 5 stars. I now buy these from my local organic grocery store.",
            "Ok. So i ordered this cheese set for Christmas. The packaging was very good, and I didnt even need to wrap it. We opened the cheeses and none of them were the cheese that were advertised, ok well they did say that they may substitute them. They were still similiar to what they had advertised. Once we opened them we were surprised to find that 3 of the 4 smelled horendous. Once again some cheeses will, we'll try and get past it. One cheese was so bad however that we almost got sick. I dont plan on buying this again for the price and what I got. If you like smelly cheese than you may like this. I cant say it was all bad, but not what I was expecting.",
            "For a black tea that is NOT Puerh by the way, it seems very expensive to me.  There is nothing special about the taste.  I have been using it to make Kombucha tea because this tea isn't robust enough for me (I prefer puerh for my hot tea).<br /><br />The packaging isn't great.  Looks nice, but being wrapped in paper, placed in a wooden box, & then having a plastic plexi glass type cover that slides into place doesn't exactly scream  fresh   to me.  Because it's in cake form, I didn't have any storage jars to keep it in.<br /><br />If you are looking for a potent black tea, try one of the puerh cakes.  You may either love it or hate it.  It's one of those things.  If you aren't feeling daring, then you might want to consider looking into Davidson's Teas right here on amazon.  You can get some amazing prices on their organic teas & they have a good selection.  Plus you can save even more with the subscribe & save.",

The flavor is not too sweet, nor is there any strange after-taste.  Very tasty!  This was the first flavor we tried, now we are going to try all of the rest but in the larger bottles.  The bottle is supposed to make about 28 servings at about $5.99 per bottle, so a much better value. We liked them so much that we went through the packets pretty quickly.  The packets are a liquid, not a powder so mix very quickly and are handy.  I think we'll end up getting them off the Flavrz website though since they also have gingerale, rootbeer, cola and many other flavors not available here.  I think that they will also make great freezer pops and sno-cones!",

            "Growing up in Dalmatian region of Croatia I never appreciated this herb ........It was widely available, commonly growing wild, and it was an every day thing.....little did I now - nothing can compare to Dalmatian Sage. Something about Adriatic Sea mist, Dalmatian soil, sun.....sage is strong and aromatic. I use sage tea every day. It is bitter, but healing. For sore gums,dental problems, plugged up sinuses, cuts, abrasions, skin problems, stomach ulcer,...I'm sure there is many more medicinal uses for this sage. Maybe even culinary uses. If you google  Dalmatian Sage  you will get much better view of it. I'm glad somebody is marketing Dalmatian sage for USA consumers, and only reason I'm not giving 5 star on this review is  - shipping and packaging. My excitement of receiving my order turned to anger when I saw huge cardboard (10x12x12) box filled with packing peanuts to ship ONE pound of dry crushed herb safely packed in to mylar bag. What a waste! Shipping was pricey, but whole thing could be mailed in the envelope! What, they were afraid it might get crushed? I will order it again, when my supply gets low, no sage can compare to Dalmatian Sage.",

I called the company and within two days had a brand new case (with a nice bonus) on the doorstep in perfect condition. The representatives for this company are beyond all doubt, extraordinary. Usually, Amazon is the first place I look for products that I cannot find locally or cheaply enough, but in this case, I would suggest ordering directly from Geraldines.",

They look a little strange yes, but with the all the wonderful delicious ingredients packed into each flavour they're incredible!! The crisps are also very versitile. We tried the Rosemary flavour with all types of cheeses...bries, stiltons, blues, cheddars, all types ! Also with liverwurst and cheez whiz! They really are great and now I can say....worth the price, because you know you are getting truly high quality crisp!!

Initially, the aroma of the dry tincture was not that pleasing. After adding 6 oz. of hot water and waiting 5 minutes to steep, my wife and I were both stunned by the taste. It has a full bodied essence that enraptures all the papilla in one unifying chorus of  Take another sip, please . I proceeded to order this canister from Amazon. We find Republic Tea exceptional over most any other brand we have tried. At least 10 to 20% better in almost every case.",
            "This is the third large batch of this stuff I've ordered.  It comes in a very convenient package that supplies enough for a bottle of water.  It's great on the job and in summer heat especially for replenishing what you sweat out working. Each little packet is a plastic foil pack that you can put in your pocket without getting it soaked as you work.  I find it does not create the stomach upset I often get with other  sports drinks  when consumed in large quantities. I've tried both the orange and mixed berry and like the flavor of both.  No chemical or acidic after taste.<br /><br />My only gripe is that you never know exactly what your ordering from the blasted descriptions they provide - not an uncommon problem on Amazon.  This case of 20 is actually 20 boxes of 10 individual packets.  When I first read it, I thought it was ridiculously expensive to get 20 little packets at this price.  It's actually 200 packets....and well worth it.",

I keep a couple cans of Annie's in my desk at work so that I've always got lunch prepped regardless of how hectic my morning might have been. I've tried the Bernie-O's, P'Sghetti Loops and the Raviolis and I've been pleased with the flavors of all three.<br />The soy meatballs in the P'Sghetti Loops are distinctive. I happen to love them, but I can understand why some people don't, they are a pretty strong flavor for meat-eaters who are used to bland hard little balls of cheap meat in the big commercial brands. The sauce is mild, creamy and very palatable, but again, if you are used to and prefer the chemical-ish overwhelming tang and flat flavor of Spaghetti-O's, you may not be a fan of Annie's.<br />I'm so glad to find it here on Amazon, and with the super saver shipping too! All of my local grocery stores have stopped carrying the Annie's canned pasta meals, and I was despairing of trying to find another quickie lunch option. Amazon to my rescue!",

You can definitely taste the raspberries and pomegranate.<br /><br />A very good choice for those with a sweet tooth who don't want or can't eat highly processed sugars.<br /><br />Great product from France.<br /><br />The lil' jars are very useful for storing spices, individual salad dressing for the lunch box, etc., and also for non food things like beads, powders, and many other craft items.<br /><br />TIP: A few of these little jars in a cellophane bag with a nice ribbon make a lovely present.",

            "In November of 2011, I downloaded the LiveStrong App and began making better choices in what I eat and began to control my caloric intake.  Limiting myself to 2,000 calories per day does not leave much room for peanut butter, or rather, sitting down in the living room in front of the television with a sleeve of crackers and my beloved jar of Jiff peanut butter and a butter knife.  Those days have long been over.  However, I still have the urges and I miss peanut butter badly.  I stumbled across PB2 when I was doing some research on a machine called Yonanas, a machine that turns frozen bananas into a creamy tasty soft serve.  I noticed in the machine reviews that some people were mixing chocolate PB2 with frozen bananas in their Yonanas machine.  I had to give this a try!  I ordered a regular PB2 and a chocolate PB2.  I must say that this stuff really really does taste wonderful considering its low calorie count.  I really love PB2.  It is giving me back something I have missed dearly.  The powder is very fine, but mixes pretty well and pretty quick.  I always start with a little less water than the directions say and work up to a little more if needed.  It is absolutely delicious to someone like me that has removed traditional peanut butter from his diet.  I highly recommend this product.  It is a pricy product, but worth every cent!  No regrets.",

A great (and Italian) way to drink it is to get coffee beans and put 1-2 in with the shot, light it on fire, blow it out (essential part here! LOL) then drink the shot and chew the coffee beans. It tames the liquor flavor and puts a bit of coffee flavor into the drink and your mouth. Have had Romana Sambucca as well but this is our family's favorite!",
            "These cookie bars are fudgy and yummy and tasty and healthy and...<br />So good!!  I am a big fan of these.  When I order a case of these I always think,  man that is a lot of cookie bars!  I am probably not going to be able to finish them all.   Probably being the operative word.  Well low and behold (with the help of my husband and 6 year old daughter) they are gone quickly and we are ordering more.  If you are adding more whole wheat to your diet, these work.  If you are looking to get rid of refined sugar in your diet, these work.  If you order them and don't like them: you must have been one of those really picky kids that grew up to be a picky adult!  They are fabulous!  To eat them is to love them.",
            "A high value treat in place of a cornstarch bone. Better for the dogs and the glucosamine is great for their joints. Our vet verified they are good for the dogs. Much less expensive than the pet stores charge which is an additional benefit. Fast shipping as well.",
            "There are few things grander than a San Miguel beer, chicharones with some datu puti, followed by a bag of dried mangoes. Your got your bitter, your sour, your salty then your sweet. It engulfs the senses and tickles your taste buds. These dried mangoes are a treat from my not-so-distant youth and I wholly approve them. They are fantastic.<br /><br />Also, there's nothing better than finding a home-sick Filipino, then seeing the light shine in their eyes when you hand them a bag or two of these. Give them a San Miguel and you've got a best friend for life.. or at least until they go back to the Phils.<br /><br />Highly recommended treat!",

But even at $2.99 each, that's a deal compared to what I pay at my local pet supply. It's $3.99 each there. So if I buy the 24 at $2.75, that's a savings of $1.24 ea even before taxes. Humn $1.24 x 24 = $29.76. Don't know where everyone has been shopping, but if you can find me a better deal, let me know. As soon as I get an extra $66, I'm biting on it - so to speak.",

This tea, if made with powdered milk, honey or a packet of stevia becomes creamy.<br /><br />Top with vanilla whipped cream and you have a vanilla raspberry bergamot tea. This is the perfect for tea parties or sipping in the morning while enjoying a raspberry muffin.<br /><br />The people who pick the tea leaves are paid a fair wage and the positive energy really does come through in the flavor of the tea. The tea leaves are also organic.<br /><br />I think this is the most delicious tea I've ever tasted! Once you try this flavor, you will want to try all the flavors. I also love the Fireside Chai.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

If a company allows such a bad shake to be in their line, then they just don't have a smart or caring management!!<br /><br />The sandy texture never goes away, and it makes your throat itch, and it's just not yummy! Highly not recommended, if you're already having doubts. Will never buy it again :)",

With hundreds of purchases and limited time I figure the good products don't need my help but the mediocre or poor products waste unsuspecting folks hard earned money. That bothers me so I rate this brand of dog cookies only 2 stars.  I have purchase most of the major dog cookie brands as I am pretty particular about what I feed my dogs. This cookie is over priced for what is in it and how small they are. There is no steak or meat used for flavoring only beef broth and grains, which is fine but the price for a small bag compared to other brands that use ground meats for flavoring is out of line. The ingredient list was missing online so I took the chance they might live up to the Steak Frites name and price. They smell good and do have wholesome grains and no fillers but so do many other brands that give you more for your dollar. The cookies are quite hard and I would not recommend them for senior dogs who have dental problems or missing teeth.",

But I'd say they're on the softer end of the gummy spectrum, eg: softer than then those two layer gummy frogs (which I also enjoy). I'd describe the taste, but I can't place it myself. The most specific I can be is to say they have a light fruity sweetness.<br /><br />A fun surprise is that these ones are quite a bit larger than those found in retail stores. I'd estimate the normal ones between one and two inches, but these are a full three and half inches in length.",

I love the smells like the heater kicking on for the first time in the fall, the onions/celery/bell pepper being cooked up for stuffing, etc. My family has been big Pennsylvania Dutch Egg Nog drinkers. Love the stuff and love that it's cheap (BIG family). I spent the holidays with my in-laws in the northeast and had this stuff for the first time. From then on, I was hooked!! You have to like egg nog of course, but the fact that it's chocolate too is even better. Very creamy, but not too thick like some other brands can be. The only drawback is I can't find the stuff where I live so I have to ship it in, which turns out to be pretty expensive in shipping costs especially since the product is usually less than $10 a bottle! I would recommend this to every egg nog lover!!",

Season (Manischewitz Co.) no longer gets these sardines from Norway.  Now they supply low grade sardines from Scotland canners.  Last year, these were the best northern sardines available; now they are inedible.  Amazon's web page is in error . . . the package now says  PRODUCT OF SCOTLAND .<br /><br />They also switched to a much lower grade oil,  pure  instead of  extra virgin .  It doesn't even taste like olive oil.  The fish have a poor texture and worse flavor.  I couldn't finish one can.  Other sardine brands have switched from Norwegian to Scottish suppliers to reduce cost before.  These are among the lowest quality commodity sardines available.  Anything in your local store has better flavor and texture.  These Season sardines are rubbery and seem under-done.<br /><br />Please understand: I'm not just saying these are not up to their previous high standard.

This, some no salt bread, Swiss cheese, homemade salt free mayonnaise, and a popular brand of lower sodium turkey can get you a decent sandwich at 400mg of sodium.

It's not the best pre-made ghee I've ever had, but it was the least expensive option on amazon.com when I bought it, and it's perfectly fine for everyday use.  I mean, ghee is just clarified butter; it's hard to screw that up and make a really bad one!  In my opinion, this one has a particularly strong flavor, which is a plus since you need less of it, and that also makes it a good mixer for combining with other oils such as olive oil (half and half ghee and olive oil makes a good sauteing oil for vegetables).  Use a little of this and maybe some other oil to saute potatoes or a variety of things and get a great and different flavor.  You probably won't need to add any additional butter either.  Also, if you want to make your grains like rice extra-tasty, saute the dry, uncooked grains a bit first in ghee, before adding the water to finish cooking them.  It is worth trying that easy extra step!",

However, I had never tried a mixed peppercorn grinder, so I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised to not only taste something with robust flavor, but also something that has some good kick to it. This pepper conglomeration isn't red-hot like jalapenos, nor is it very mild or lifeless; it has just the right amount of kick to it. This grinder is great for salads, hamburgers, or anything that needs a little more flavor. Plus.....it lasts a long time (months, with regular use). So, spruce up your food with some mixed peppercorns, and enjoy.",

            "A few days ago I was posting some rather disparaging comments about Grace Hot Sauce. This sauce<br />however, blows its baby brother away with a raw, firey Scotch Bonnet flavor. This is about as basic<br />as you can get, though it does seem to straddle the line a bit between hot sauce and condiment. When<br />the sweet Jamaican smoke is cleared, however, this is a great hot sauce that's made to be enjoyed.<br /><br />Scotch Bonnets are relatives of habaneros, but if habaneros are the serious, hard working pepper plugged<br />into so many independent American hot sauces, Scotch Bonnets are their laid-back island cousin, just as<br />hot but more relaxed and sweeter leaning more towards spice and flavor. Scotch Bonnets would rather look<br />silly and taste tropical than merely kill you with heat. This sauce, a colorful yellow, is Grace's best<br />condiment by a long shot. The simple mashing of Scotch Bonnets, with some slight flavor accentuators<br />really captures the heat of the islands and flavor of a solid hot sauce.<br /><br />In the description on their website, Grace promises a challenge.  Add a drop or two to food for a truely<br />serious pepper experience,  though heat freaks may need to up this number by a few shakes of the bottle.<br />This sauce does have a minor tropical blast which won't floor you at once, but provides a long lingering<br />burn cycle that will continue as long as you keep eating the sauce....and you will. However, still be able<br />to taste your food and thats a plus in a world of dangerous, murderous sauces lurking around every corner.<br />It's hot enough to hang with some of the bad boys, but the flavor outshines the heat in the end.<br /><br />Sweet, rich, hot, and delicious, this sauce will absolutely not disappoint. The double-punch of cane vinegar<br />and cane sugar/citric acid give the sauce fruity tropical hints and a tangy, acidic flavor. The sauce becomes<br />tricky when you factor in the fact that it contains modified starch and ascorbic acid. These ingredients thicken<br />the sauce, gelling it a bit so that it seems like crushed peppers in a sauce the consistency of a heavier BBQ<br />sauce. This is not a bad thing at all, but be prepared to feel like you're eating a hot sauce masquerading as a<br />thick condiment. Flavor is spot on, but consistency is a bit unnatural for a traditional hot sauce.<br /><br />I love this sauce on cold pizza and pizza crust and smoked turkey sandwiches, just to name a few. However,<br />because it has such a bright, sunshine taste, I think it can accentuate other Caribbean dishes which tend to<br />use jerk spice (also made from Scotch Bonnets). If you have a sandwich with sweeter ingredients, this sauce is<br />for you. Also a great tag team partner for mango or pineapple salsas. 5 Scovies!",

Purchasing a cookbook online, even our grocery stores don't sell the spices needed to create such dishes.<br /><br />I met a Pakistani woman on a flight from LA who introduced me to these Shan mixes.  She said they are very authentic, spicy.  All you need to add is the meat/vegies.  The instructions are printed in English on the back of the box and are easy to follow.  She sent me some and I tried them.  They are delicious.  And yes, SPICY!!!!  I was afraid to use the whole packet of spice for my chappli kabab, so I used 2/3's of it.  Even that much was alomst too spicy.  The flavor was magnificent.",

            "This cereal has a delicious whole-grain flavor and makes for a great healthier cream-of-wheat option, as it's made up of 100% whole-grain coarsely-ground wheat and brown rice, plus additional wheat bran.  This shows in the nutritional info as well, as 1/3 cup (33g) has 7g fiber (28% daily value) in only 23g total carbs (9% daily value) and 5g protein as well.<br /><br />Here's how I make it for a quick and hearty hot breakfast:  I take roughly a heaping 1/3 cup of it, a small handful (~1 tbsp) of some dried fruit (i.e., raisins or the like), a pinch of salt, a tiny bit of sweetener (honey, agave, real maple syrup, etc.), and a cup of any type of milk (my favorite for this purpose being my homemade almond milk) and nuke it for 3 minutes.  It comes out a bit loose but after sitting for another few minutes, it thickens up considerably and is also now cool enough to actually eat.<br /><br />Typically what I'll do is prepare the above in the bowl I'll be eating it out of (which takes all of around a minute to put together total), put it in the microwave to cook and go about continuing with my morning routine.  When I get back to it roughly 10 minutes later, all it needs is a quick stir and it's ready.  Yum!",

            "Yummeh. Blueberries are not my favorite fruit, but when I opened my package I knew I was going to love this just as much as the mango. The scent was strong blueberry! It reminded me of fruit leather, deep purple, chewy, yummy homemade fruit leather by the hippie auntie I used to have. Ah sense memory, I love it so.<br />So I whisked up this delight with the plan to make a couple little lattes - one with soymilk, one with almond and one with regular. I don't know, I just wanted to taste the nuances and find my favorite pairing I guess! Also to see which milk went best with fruit flavoured matcha.<br /><br />Honestly though, I really enjoyed this one sans milk - just with some sugar. (I also experimented with sweetener, and found I prefer sugar over agave for my matcha).<br /><br />The froth! I got a crazy amount of froth with no clumps in this batch. I definitely credit the quality of the matcha for that, because my whisk skills are shoddy at best. That's when I knew I was in for a treat today. This blueberry matcha in particular was very smooth. The berry taste fluctuated from sip to sip - one sip it was a tart not quite ripe berry, the second it was an overly plump, huge juicy ripe berry. The aftertaste was definitely the latter. The flavouring felt more strong in this batch than I expected, but I loved that very much. What a deal :D Again, I love that this company uses natural flavouring - it really shows in the quality of this matcha that it tastes like the berries, not like a candy.<br />With almond milk, the matcha latte tastes almost like a baked good - a blueberry matcha scone or shortbread. The soymilk tasted, well, like soymilk (I think it was my least favorite of the 3). With hot frothed 2% milk it was very sweet. I find hot milk to be naturally sweet, so that probably accounts for it!<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, I had it as an iced latte. (If you're wondering, with all this crazy matcha energy - I'm learning the ukulele!) I HIGHLY recommend enjoying these fruit flavour matchas from Red Leaf Tea as iced lattes. Oh my goodness! The fruit flavour just comes alive and honestly tasted like a blended real fruit smoothie. Of course, once I get a blended I will be making blended iced drinks 100% - but until then, the ice cubes will suffice.",

I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.

It keeps my whipped cream stiff for hours, it pipes well and fills without weeping into the cake.<br />My only criticism is that it tends to make tiny air bubbles in the cream, resulting in a not-so-smooth coat or perfectly piped borders, but it's probably because I aerate it too much (my fault).  Overall, I love this and its so hard to find at the grocery stores here...So THANKS AMAZON! I LOVE YOU!",
            "I use a lot of ground cayenne pepper.  This is the third kind I've tried in the last year, and it is by far the best.  It is spicier and has much more flavor than the other kinds.  And one kind I tried was grown, dried, and ground by some family members and given to us.<br /><br />This cayenne from Badia has simply the best flavor.  And it's spicy!  I don't need to use nearly as much as with other brands when I cook, and I still get more flavor.  That alone makes it worth the extra money and time waiting for it to ship.  You don't need to use as much.<br /><br />This cayenne is a nice, dark red.  Very, very finely ground.  There is only a shaker option, and luckily, it doesn't come flying out.<br /><br />I still cannot get over how much more flavor and spiciness this Badia Cayenne Pepper has versus other ones we've tried.  It has flavor, not just spice.  I don't want any other kind anymore after having used this.  Superior quality product.  If you enjoy cayenne pepper, I would highly recommend going organic and choosing this one from Badia.  It isn't a brand I've heard of until I purchased this, but it makes me want to seek it out with other spices in the future.",

The initial smell is excellent. An aroma of pepper and brown sugar.<br /><br /> However, the Jerky itself is somewhat sticky. The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky. My guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator, we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well.<br /><br /> As for how spicy. Well, my lips are burning. I like that. I really love Habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). This isn't some &quot;slightly spicy&quot; product with the name Habanero in it to make it seem macho. It will scorch your mouth. In my opinion, scorch in a good way.<br /><br /> The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway.<br /><br /> Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product.<br /><br /> I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves.<br /><br /> Definitely recommended.",

            "We've been enjoying McCormick's crock-pot chilli for some time now so I thought why not try this newest recipe. Of course it's simple: chicken ( I use thighs with skin removed ), a couple cans of stewed tomatoes ( plain is good, Italian better ), can of tomato paste and a half pound of sliced mushrooms. That's it. I put these ingredients in my slow cooker around noon time. A while later ( 4-5 hours on high or 8 hours on low per the instructions ) it's ready. It can be eaten as is or, as we do, put on top of spaghetti. Sometimes to make it even more like spaghetti sauce I'll add a can of marinara ( Hunt's works well ) which is just the right touch and stretches the sauce base.<br /><br />  This dish isn't what you'd call 'gourmet' but when time is an issue using this mix will definitely make life easier. The only down side to using thighs I find is pulling out the bones and other things not wanted. But thighs are inexpensive and tasty. I've also used chicken breast sliced into long strips which is better if you have young ones who just want to dive in and can't watch for those unwanted items.<br /><br />  Along with the chilli mix and the beef stew mix ( both get eaten very quickly around here ) the Italian Herb mix is a good kitchen tool to have when a wholesome, quick meal is called for. It's easily modified to taste and keeps you coming back for more. And buying these mixes from Amazon in bulk packs almost cuts the cost in half compared to individual packs bought at large food stores. Can't beat that!",

            "This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something  strawberry  should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively  healthy  fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",

I am sure glad I just got a 4oz portion.  This is the worst - absolutely bar none (and that includes chow-hall coffee from my military service years)  The taste is flatter than flat, the aroma is non-existent - in short it is awful.

I used to get these all the time, in the previous place I used to live I used to get the 16.4 ounce bottles for 3.95. they sent me 2 16.4 ounce bottles instead of 4 6.4 ounce bottles, so I actually got 6 ounces more than normal but at 2X the cost. but considering shipping was spendy and it took a month for them to get here, at 25$ for 2 bottles I will never be doing this again. buyer beware, if you are looking to get some of these, its in your best interest to contact someone from another town and have them look for you, itd be far cheaper.",

Glad I did, because it's great, and will last me a while.",

            "My family goes through a lot of seltzer, and recently we purchased a SodaStream to make our own seltzer at home and eliminate the bags of cans that we had to return each week. Before I got started making flavored seltzer, I researched flavorings and the Bakto products seemed the best: they are natural extracts that contain no sugar or artificial sweetener. To try these products and figure out if this was a good way to flavor seltzer water, I started by purchasing the Vanilla & Citrus collection which comes with Vanilla, Bergamot, Coriander (the seed of the cilantro plant, a common cooking spice), Lemon, Lime and Orange. Lemon coriander makes an excellent seltzer flavor, btw.<br /><br />All are high quality extracts, and the only one that is of no use for flavoring seltzer is the bergamot, which is an oil extract rather than a water-soluble alcohol extract. That was kind of a disappointment, because I love bergamot flavor, but I grow bergamot in my garden, so I can just stick a fresh sprig into my seltzer if I really want to! I highly recommend these products.",

Even so, knowing that many things can go wrong in breadmaking, I may try it again, but I would certainly not be willing to pay the price here just to check my first opinion.

            "I bought this coffee because the product website said the Vermont Country Blend is a medium roast with mellow, smooth and  brisk taste. It is some of those things, it just doesn't taste that good. VCB has a little bit of a gas station coffee flavor in that it's a bit abrasive. You can almost taste the soil the coffee was grown in before you taste the coffee itself--if you like an earthy taste with a hint of road-trip rest stop, this is the coffee for you. The most disappointing thing about this coffee is the amount of sugar needed to sweeten it. I need three times the amount of sweetener for it to taste like I added something. (I used the same measurements that I use every morning: a 10 ounce mug plus one teaspoon of sweetener but with VCB I need 3 teaspoons to taste the sweetener and I could add more but I can't bring myself to dump much more into the cup.) Perhaps Green Mountain makes other blends that taste better, but my experience with VCB hasn't been that positive.",

            "The coffee beans that I normally order from Amazon are different varieties of  Eight O'Clock coffees. But I did add this Copper Moon Hazelnut coffee last week to my regular order of  Eight O'Clock coffee just to try it out.<br /><br />The Copper Moon Hazelnut coffee arrived well sealed in a plastic bag, but was lacking that smell of fresh coffee beans when the bag is first opened, and after they are ground. The coffee beans are a light brown with no sign of any oily sheen on them. They also lack the stronger coffee taste of the regular Eight O'Clock beans that I have ordered.<br /><br />It is a smooth light roast, not a medium roast, with no hint of a chemical or burnt taste, compared to some other flavored coffee beans that I've tried, and is a good sipping coffee.  The Hazelnut flavoring is slight, but you are aware that it is there. My wife prefers it to the stronger medium roast taste of the Eight O'Clock coffees I buy, but for me it is a bit too bland.<br /><br />If you wish to have a smooth tasting morning cup of light bodied coffee without any annoying aftertaste, then this might be the coffee for you, but I prefer a stronger coffee taste from my coffee beans.",

            "These taste okay, but dissolve very fast. For Xylitol, I prefer Xyloburst Berry mints that take longer to dissolve, or you can chew them if you like.<br /><br />It's like this - when I first got these, I over-ate them. The dentist says to consume 6-10 mg of Xylitol per day for your teeth. Each piece of these candies contains .4 mg, and 1 tin has 100 pieces, or 40 mg. Too much Xylitol isn't dangerous, but it can cause uncomfortable bowel changes, which is what happened to me. So now I'm more cautious about it.<br /><br />My strategy now, is to have some candies that are easy to consume (like these) to get my 6-10 mg a day of Xylitol, as well as some other very yummy ones that have low Xylitol for the amount of time it takes to consume them, like Dr. John's lozenge shape hard candies or Sparx. I've got a candy bowl set out that starts out with a dozen .5 mg Xyloburst berry mints in it, that I either eat or substitute for other candies during the day, to keep track of the Xylitol, and I haven't had any more problems with eating too much of it this way. (I don't keep track of the hard candies or Sparx - I eat whatever I want of those.)<br /><br />FYI, Dr. John's website also sells Xylitol lemonade that's interesting to try. I've found it can be mixed different strengths according to your taste and mood, and leaves me wanting plain water afterwards rather than another sweet drink.",
            "I purchased 11 boxes of these gummy worms and divided them all into baggies of two worms each for a demonstration in a biology class.  I specifically chose this product because it said a count of 240, as opposed to 5 pounds.  (I have no idea how many worms is in 5 pounds and I needed about 2600).  While we only counted a couple of the boxes out, I know that the final bag count indicates each box averages 10-15% short on worms (24-40 worms per bag).  I ended up running out when I should have had a couple hundred extra.  Quality of the worms was good though.",

I noticed this Robertsons brand on the shelf and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The Robertsons was a couple of dollars less than the Dundee brand, but it was only 12 oz as opposed to 16 oz for Dundee.<br /><br /> I found it to be an excellent bitter sweet marmalade, although slightly sweeter than I prefer. A more bitter than sweet flavor would be more to my liking, but that's a matter of personal preference. I like rind in my marmalade and it had a decent amount of rind in it but it seemed less than the Dundee brand.<br /><br />Scotland is the home of bitter sweet marmalade, this is where Dundee was made for many years until they shifted there plant to England recently. All of the rest of Europe and the U.S. produce a sweeter version of orange marmalade.<br /><br />I would defiantly buy this brand again, that is of course if I could not find the Dundee brand.<br /><br />NOTE;; I am assuming the SCOTCH on the label refers to Scotland, there is unfortunately no Scotch whisky in this marmalade.",

            "I bought this set a few years ago since I was interested in arabic/turkish coffee, but had no clue about how to make it. The ibrik that came with this set is a very nice brass with a detachable handle (great for the constant moving students have to do...). It is my favorite of the six I have as it usually produces the best foam and is easier to pour and use. The set also includes two very nice solid demitasse cups and saucers. They're not anything fancy, but since they're very thick they give an air of robust simplicity. The coffees that the set came with are also very good, though perhaps not as good as say Mehmet Effendi (which is what I've subsequently taken to drinking). The included instructions are also pretty clear about what measurements you should use and how you should prepare the coffee.  All in all, for the price this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to break out of the coffee drinking box. Give it a try.<br /><br />NOTE: As I mentioned earlier, the ibrik is brass and, as a result, will tarnish over time. A quick polish will get it looking new again, but it's just something to be aware of.",

            "I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says  keeps best refrigerated or frozen,  and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.",

We gradually tapered off the Nutro and introduced some new stuff. The cats stopped having problems and were no longer vomiting or having loose stools. A couple months down the road our male cat started peeing in different places and wouldn't go in the litter box. We took him to the vet to find out he had a severe UTI and that this had been going on for 2-3 months. We traced it back to about the time we started feeding him this Nutro Indoor Cat formula. I feel this food is to blame for his severe UTI conditions. Perhaps it's not the only culprit, but considering the awful side effects, it might have been the top contributor.<br /><br />Lots of pet owners are disowning Nutro and switching to something with better quality checks.<br /><br />If you are having problems with Nutro, call the company at 1-800-833-5330 and tell them your claim and what is happening to your pet.<br /><br />Here is a link of pet owners with problems with this cat food :<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I no longer feel safe purchasing any type of Nutro cat food for my beloved pets.",

The grackles just power through most seed cakes, but the feeder also attracts wrens, who don't care to hang upside down, so I hesitate to replace the feeder with an upside-down feeder, though it would thwart the grackles. These cakes are less expensive than the ones I was buying previously, and they seem to be a bit harder, so they discourage the grackles at least a little, while still attracting the woodpeckers and wrens.",

I was unable to find anywhere that sold this tea until recently, when I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. This is a very sweet tea - I always add sugar to tea and this one is sweet enough without any extra sugar. However, the sweetness is not overpowering as it also has a strong spice flavor. It smells amazing while brewing and tastes just as good. It makes excellent hot or iced tea, with or without milk/cream. If you are looking for something a little bit different to spice up your tea cabinet, this is the perfect choice for you!",

The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some  healthy  pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this.

If it had been my first experience with a green drink, I would have given up drinking them immediately. This stuff is awful! I have to literally hold my breath and force myself to drink it. Not only does it taste terrible, but it contains lots of small particles that irritate my throat making me want to cough. In addition, there is always a sizable amount of material left at the bottom of the glass, even though I stir it every time I take a drink. This is the berry flavored version of this product, but it doesn't have a hint of berry flavor. I'm also thankful that I only bought a small size container, and I will definitely be going back to my original brand (Trader Joe's) after I finish all of this one. If I can finish all of this one, that is.",
            "Citrusmint is probably the best Orbit flavor, and I've tried them all. This is the first gum that I actually chew like it's a real food product, and not just some chewy mint. I make it through about a pack a day, it's that good. Citrusmint is somewhat of a misnomer, as there is really no mint flavor to it, just a burst of refreshing orange. The texture of the gum also seems softer than most of the other Orbit flavors, making it even more appetizing. This is truly a world-class gum and it's good for your teeth as well. On the downside, as with all the Orbit varieties, the package is poorly designed and  sometimes it can be difficult to remove the individual pieces of gum. However, this inconvenience is a small price to pay to experience such a magnificent gum.",

Here's my story: After stopping drinking tea for pregnancy, I was looking for a caffeine free tea. When I shopped for maternity pants, I saw this in Motherhood. I bought one and tried it that night. I liked it immediately and drank four glasses of two tea bags. That night, I was shocked to see my weight dropped 3 lbs. I didn't know why and continued drinking this tea until I was out of it in two weeks. I started looking for this tea online and came across a website, where a lady said her doctor didn't recommend it for first trimesters because it could cause contraction. Another website said that the raspberry leaves were considered cause contractions and could cause miscarriage among first trimesters. I then found this tea on Amazon and ordered it, deciding to stop drinking it until I entered 2nd trimester. Unfortunately, at my u/s I was the fetus stopped growing at 3 weeks ago. I looked through the journal, it was the week that I started drinking this tea.  The tea tastes light and refreshing, but it should have printed a warning on its package.",

Some of the leaves are still a little scrunched from being in the box, but I think they will straighten out as they relax a bit.  The color of the leaves is just right...not cheap looking at all, and the leaves don't have rough stringy edges like some less expensive ones I've had. The plant is just the right size where you need something in a corner or some other spot where you need a little taller plant, but it doesn't overpower the room. The Spathyfillum comes in the pot shown in the photo, but I set it, planter and all, into a large nicer looking ceramic planter, and it's stunning.  It is very realistic, and to me, this is definitely worth what it costs.  I would order again.",
            "In terms of wholesomeness and nutritional value, this sweetened Uncle Sam cereal is miles ahead of 99% of what sits on the shelves of average grocery store's cereal aisle.  The amount of sugar is  relatively small -- 7 grams. The ingredients are wholesome and natural.  Here they are:  Toasted whole wheat berry flake (whole wheat kernels, salt, barley malt), flaxseed, evaporated cane juice, freeze-dried strawberries, natural strawberry flavor.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars?  It's the flavor and fat.  A 3/4 cup serving has 240 calories, 5 grams of fat.  There just is not enough flavor to justify those numbers.  Thankfully, 8 grams of dietary fiber offers significant health benefits.  A nice counterbalance.  BTW, 3 grams are soluble and 4 grams of that fiber are insoluble.<br /><br />For a healthy, tasty breakfast cereal I prefer <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000LKTMLM >Food For Life Ezekiel 4:9 Organic Sprouted Whole Grain Cereal, Original, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> with only 190 calories, 1 gram of fat, 6 grams of fiber, and 0 grams of sugar. It tastes better than Uncle Sam Strawberry and, of course, I can add my own strawberries when they are in season.  The <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3FS >Uncle Sam Toasted Whole Wheat Berry Flakes & Flaxseed Original Cereal, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> is also a better option; albeit with more fat and sugar than the Ezekiel.",
            "I bought this together with the skinless and boneless sardines (105g) made by the same company - Angelo Parodi because the other one was supposed the best sardine in the list of a sardine lover.  I found that is simply not the case.  Strangely, this sardines is actually better than the skinless/boneless one.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />(1) More substance - this can of sardine weighs 120g, only slightly more than the boneless/skinless (105g), however, they actually have a lot more sardines than the other one because the other one only have a few sardines floating in a lot of olive oil.  This one actually have more  meat  and at a price of $ 2.89 comparing to the $ 3.69 for the boneless/skinless version, this one is a better buy.<br /><br />(2) Taste - it has a really good and firm texture.  The sizes of the sardines are a little big.  They remind me of the Delmonte sardines in tomato sauce I used to eat when I was young.  They did not have any fishy taste. (*I cannot stand any fishes that have fishy taste) It is just a little bit too salty for me but really not bad.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Like the can of the boneless/skinless sardines, it is very difficult to open the can by pulling the ring.  It is very easy to cut yourself if you are not careful.",
            "This natural sweetener product tastes better than other liquid stevia I have tried, it tastes sweet without any chemical aftertaste.  This sweetener works very well instead of sugar in most applications (beverages), though with black coffee it is clear the product is not sugar.  Its probably the acidity level in the coffee that creates a different result than that with Iced Tea, which tastes very good with stevia.<br /><br />Other Stevia products have tasted more like a chemical to me when tried.",

            "We have deer, rabbits, groundhogs, and probably a few other critters that love to get into our garden. I bought this fence energizer to keep them out, and it works very well. However, I'm having second thoughts about the continuous current. One of my fence lines is just a few inches above the ground to keep out rabbits and groundhogs. The other day I found a dead starling under it. I don't really feel too bad about the starling ... it has been pulling up seedlings ... but it made me realize that small animals probably can't escape the strong, constant shock. Some other chargers use a pulsing current, and they may give the same animals a chance to break free and get away.<br /><br />I will continue to monitor this. All it will take will be one dead rabbit and my wife will insist that the charger be removed. As is, I am running it only at night to minimize the chances of accidently shocking a pet or person!<br /><br />If you intend to use a low fence wire, or if you are going to use it where kids might touch it, consider a pulsing fence energizer.",

It's an acquired taste, however.  The closed Durian cookies to my house are 80 miles away in a Vietnamese Grocery.  I guess someone once bought them, went outside and ate one, came running back in freaking out, so the Grocer tries to not let me buy them until I assure him I know what they are.  My kids were totally grossed out (fun!), but now the older one eats them.  Durian Ice Cream is better, I think, if you want a low-level Durian fix, but it's much harder to find.

I've also never heard of making smores with peanut butter, but for some reason these have a bunch of little M&M-sized peanut butter candy things inside.  Also, the marshmallow-like extrusions are pretty hard to crunch up.  Overall, I liked this reasonably well (the graham chunks are good, as are the cocoa almonds and honey-roasted peanuts - and even the hard marshmallows), but the peanut butter really turns me off.  If you, however, enjoy the way the peanut butter-like filling in a generic Reeces peanut butter cup tastes, and you think you would like that taste on smores, you may also like this. :)",

            "This product is the straw that broke the camel's back, making me 100% convinced I should not eat anything made in India.  Of course, it helps I have a long history of frequenting Indian groceries for staples such as frozen naan and papadam...and it doesn't help that I frequently find half-exploded cans of botulism-encrusted, expired, imported Indian goo in any random neighborhood Indian grocery.<br /><br />So here's my report on first opening the package:<br /><br />The jaggery looks like unreasonably yellow tofu cube looking sugar blocks; they are not the lovely and natural blond or brunette of colombian panela or mexican piconcillo.  The smell is horrible, something like the plastic on a bad capacitor that has burned out, the smell of a soldering iron, something strangely industrial and/or metallic and/or plastic and/or burning.  Brake dust.  Computer on fire.  Pthalates burning in a trash heap.  Scumdog millionaire sets the pool toy factory aflame next door to the sugar fields.<br /><br />...This is food???<br /><br />Ok, I thought, maybe it's the packaging that I'm smelling, so I drop them in some water to bring to a boil.<br /><br />First thing happens, yellow color starts emanating from the cubes.   Oh , I think to myself,  It's been hit with yellow #5, or at best, Turmeric .<br /><br />Next I notice the jaggery starts to bubble.  Bubble?  My mexican piconcillo doesn't do that.  It's just sugar, right?<br /><br />Finally, as it dissolves, I waft the scent of brake dust, caramel, something strange like a fake beef or meat flavor, something strangely umami but muskier.<br /><br />Then I dump the whole thing and toss out the 2 lbs of jaggery I bought.<br /><br />No more Indian food.  The irony is that you have a perfect product that nature produces, then you have to adulterate it, overcomplicating it with garbage, making it unacceptable.<br /><br />Attention India and China: I will not participate in your industrial-waste-laundering-through-food scheme.",

If you're fine literally going through a pack a day (or a pack every few hours, if you like to constantly chew gum), this isn't bad.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-GREAT, FRESH FLAVOR: I love how intensely minty gum is--the initial burst of flavor is comparable to an Altoids mint. Leaves your mouth feeling very clean. Flavor is much more intense than regular Orbit gum.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-SHORT-LIVED: Gum gets stale just as fast as those $.25 gumball candies. The wonderful flavor lasts about all of 30 seconds before it begins to dissolve into an unappealing, flavorless mass. You know that feeling when your gum tastes gross because it's so old, but you don't have anywhere to throw it away? I get that feeling less than 10 minutes in. A regular individually wrapped piece of Orbit gum could last me over an hour.<br />-NOT TOOTH-WHITENING: That bit of advertising is a bit misleading. I don't think it doesn't anything to whiten teeth moreso than gum normally would--just by nature of being sugarless and picking up pieces of plaque. If you were expecting some tasty tooth whitener, look elsewhere. This doesn't affect my opinion of the gum because I never expected it to, but just throwing it out there.",

Having transitioned from Starbucks ESE pods, to Illy, and now this - this espresso taste and experience is by far the best.<br />HOWEVER, every pod I have opened has not been packed tightly enough.  So, the first few times I made this espresso, it was horrible.  When I figured out the issue, I have had to open up every pod, dump it into my basket, tamp it down, and make it.  This, obviously, is completely the opposite point of having the pods.  Having used several other companies' pods, it is easy to see (once I ruined a few initial tries) that these pods are significantly looser than anyone else'.  I will not buy the Bristot pods again, but will instead look for just loose grounds, in a can or bag.<br />GREAT ESPRESSO when it is packed right - would never suggest the pods.",

I steep mine for 5 minutes and sometimes add almond milk or just drink it black.

The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice.",

            "First off, can I say that I LOVE Nando's? It's a peri-peri restaurant chain that has many branches worldwide and which I know and love as a favorite standby from the UK, but which has only a couple of branches in the US. Neither of those branches are within even a thousand miles of my home in Ohio, so my Nando's fixes are very few and far between. I love that their peri-peri sauces are available in the US, and buy them whenever I can as an all-purpose condiment to serve with anything and everything that could do with a bit of spicing up.<br /><br />Secondly... while I LOVE these sauces, even the  extra hot  version doesn't even begin to come close to some of the sauces that real chili-heads will be used to, i.e. the ones that rate so high on the Scoville scale that you're advised to only add them to your food one minuscule drip at a time. Nando's sauces are more of the  slosh generously all over your plate  variety if you have any kind of a taste and tolerance for the burny stuff, and I tend to use it more like ketchup than a genuine  hot  sauce. That's not meant as an insult to the sauces, though - don't get me wrong, I really do love them, but I get through a whole lot more of this stuff than I do the dangerously hot sauces I buy almost entirely for the burn. Nando's peri-peri sauces are just not like that; they're meant to be enjoyed for their complex flavor rather than as a challenge, so please don't buy a bottle of this stuff expecting to have your head blown off with a single taste.<br /><br />I love the Nando's Extra Hot and Hot sauces as a dip for fries and anything else that requires dunking, and it is also a firm favorite in my household when mixed liberally with a bit of mayo and/or sour cream for a spicy dipping sauce that works well with appetizers of all kinds. It works really well as a marinade for chicken, too - definitely one to try when you're grilling out.<br /><br />My only  problem  (and it's not really a problem, as such) is that I get through these little bottles far too quickly. Anyone who's ever been to a Nando's restaurant will know that customers can take as many HUGE bottles (I mean, containing maybe 2-3 pints) of peri-peri sauce in any and every strength and flavor variation back to their table to apply as freely to their meal as they wish. When I try that at home I find I've emptied a $5 bottle of sauce before I know it. I just wish they'd start making it available in stores in industrial-sized bottles for dedicated Nando-lovers such as myself!<br /><br />Finally, if you ever find yourself in a city that has a Nando's restaurant, I'd heartily recommend that you go along and try it out. Order some peri-peri chicken to suit your own personal chili tolerance level, a Portuguese or Brazilian beer and (my personal favorite) a bowl of their spicy mixed nuts to munch on while you wait for your order (these are SERIOUSLY hot and I love them so very, very much) and, well... enjoy! :)",

            "My daughter picked this one out - she LOVES truffles and of course raspberry is one of her favorites. She has not got to try it yet as she is at work but I had to sneak a bit since I was putting my matcha powders into their tins.<br /><br />So this one has a very nice raspberry flavor, although I seem to be missing the chocolate flavor, not that I taste no chocolate but its not like the chocolate matcha flavor.  However truffles have a very distinctive flavor to them - which for me is difficult to describe, but this does taste very true to an actual truffle and not simply to flavors of matcha mixed together. So its not just some chocolate flavor with raspberry flavor but however this was blended with whatever ingredients it is true to that truffle aroma and flavor. I wish I could explain the flavor I am talking about maybe it is some kind of special nut oil that is used or something but there is just a flavor to truffles that is different and this matcha absolutely has captured it!<br /><br />So today I began with the preparation of the matcha and was going to do my typical latte but last minute before adding the creamer decided to use a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream hubby was so lovely to pick up for me. So my blend included the prepared matcha along with some ice cubes, a quarter cup of milk, and a small scoop of ice cream. It was not that amazing of a plan since the ice cubes and ice cream wanted to be stubborn but I took a long tea spoon and mixed it up and ate it something like a float.<br /><br />Mmmmm absolutely delicious! The raspberry truffle flavor popped along with the creamy ice cream here and there in a milky frothy treat!<br /><br />The lingering after taste is what is most astounding! I had this matcha latte shake concoction over 15 minutes ago and I am still tasting raspberry chocolaty goodness in my mouth!<br /><br />Of course as always Red Leaf Tea's matcha base is outstanding!",
            "I have been reading that only Ceylon Cinnamon helps with diabetes, cholesterol and weight loss.  Up until now, I did not realize this and have been using the so-called cheap cinnamon.  I started at 170 pounds and a size 12, within 3 weeks I had dropped to a size 10, by  12 weeks I was into a size 8.  I am now a size 2, have lost 50 pounds, that occurred by 6-7 months.  My blood sugar was 289 fasting and a HgbA1c of 10.8, I never started any medications.  I have a 2 hour postprandial blood sugar in the 80's and my HgbA1c is 5.4. I had a high 300's cholesterol and my triglycerides were close to 500 and that was with medication.  My doctor has taken me off cholesterol pills and has cut my blood pressure pill in half. Even with BP medication, I always ran high, now sometimes I am actually very low in the 90/50's range first thing in the morning.  Okay, I did stop eating the bread and the potato chips, dip, however, I had done that in the past and without the cinnamon, well I would lose a few pounds and that was it.

Product comes in a very large bottle and has no sprinkle top so you might want to put it in a shaker to dispense. Price is VERY reasonable and spices are fresh!

Yeah you can use more milk and less butter but it still tastes like buttery slightly cheesy slippery cardboard. If you need something in your stomach and don't really care about taste, quality, actual cheesie-ness and care more about cost, convienance and packaging this is for you. The box says it feeds mulitple people (don't remember how many servings total) but when I made it it barely came out more than 2 rather scrawny looking bits. If you plan on having three sides with your entree then have fun. Our family was not impressed. Plus the original chessiest tastes better than this crap.

On the strength of advice from a woman who had 3 dogs with various stomach issues (none of her dogs was a pure breed, so it's not just for expensive, overbred dogs like mine!) I tried it for my dog and we haven't gone back to the Prescription brand. Yes, it's more expensive than grocery store dog food, but it's a little less expensive than the vet-prescribed food. And, I've saved in further vet and medication costs b/c her stomach isn't churned up by other brands. It's well worth the cost. Get a small bag to start, and go from there!",

Not one to give up easily, based upon its description and reviews, I decided finally to try Tazo Organic Green Tea Bags.  What a delightful difference!  There is no comparison between Tazo Organic Green Tea Bags and the others I have tried! Every Tazo tea bag seems to say,  Scrupuously clean, scrupulously cared for!  It would have been to my advantage had I realized sooner that Tazo Organic Green Tea bags make wonderfully delicious green tea--- no strange after taste, no strange sensation in the tummy...simply so superior to the others I had tried! But then there are those times in life when you have to get to know what good is! Well,I have found the good which truly is  excellent plus  for green tea in this particular brand.<br />In my opinion Tazo organic green tea bags raises the bar and sets the standard for a great cup of green tea!

Apparently not impossible to find in MA but difficult, particularly not owning a car (common in Cambridge) and using public transport or Zipcar.<br /><br />I really like these croutons on top of chili and in Tex-Mex salads. I think they work better than corn chips or cornbread. I only just discovered them so I am sure there are more uses. What I like about them is that they add crunch but are not aggressively seasoned like most croutons.<br /><br />Someone was pretty darn clever when they came up with this idea.

            "I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%. While it tastes similar to real avena, the overly processed ingredients give me pause. I will be looking for a recipe for real avena which is probably not that hard to make and a lot healthier.<br /><br />As a sidenote, you can buy this at your local supermarket (in the section of south american foods) in 8 oz containers for half the price.",

What a joy for my daughter to be able to eat a hamburger  just like everyone else using a  right out of the bag  bun.  She toasted it, and ate the whole thing with a smile.  However, I was just a little concerned about the overwhelming yeast smell opening the package.  Then even more concerned when I read the storage instructions:  Keep in a cool dry place, does not need freezing, refrigerate after opening.  Expires 4 20 11.  So this tells me the buns are loaded with some type of preservative(s).  This can't be good for you.  The daughter stopped liking them so much because she too began complaining about the  yeast  or maybe it was mold taste.  Now out of six packages we have four left.  All the buns in the sealed packages are molded.  We purchased them July 7, 2010 and received a week or so later.  Today is August 25 2010 remember the expiration date is spring 2011!  We have since found out she can't have yeast on top of gluten, casein, and egg yolks.  So we couldn't buy them again anyway.  I just don't think I could recommend them even we could buy them.  Too expensive for them to go to waste like this, and I am very leery of preservatives that would allow these to last so long without freezing or refrigeration.",

I switched to grain free dog food and tried a few different brands. He seemed to enjoy most of them, but the Wilderness brand even had my cats trying to sneak food out of the dog's bowl. So I switched them to Wilderness for cats. What a difference it's made. Soft, shiny coats, great skin, no more stinky, runny poops in the litter boxes. Oh, and my dog has now been hive/itch free for six months. Amazon's prices are very competitive, and free shipping means I don't have to make a trip to the pet store and haul it home.",

They are quite overpriced at the regular price of $62.00, but if you can catch them on sale, as I did through Warehouse Deals, they are well worth it. 5 stars is for the quality of the product, not the price.",

Our family has about 7-10 teas available at any one time and the Shanghai Orchid is a great  accent tea  to the plain teas...take a straight jasmine pearl or the Darjeeling or the silver needle and add some of the Orchid...wow!  The smell of flowers translates to taste beautifully.  Of course the price is high and I find it is confusing to purchase tea in the shop because of the  ounce  pricing...however if you use this tea as an accent rather than a straight tea, the idea is it will last longer.  My favorite is using this tea with any plan jasmine.  Amazing!",

And you can use the nice container for other stuff after the chocolate powder is gone. This Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Dutch Chocolate Powder mix is multi-functional as well. On the container, there are recipes for not only Hot Chocolate but also Cafe Mocha and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Original Ice Blended Coffee drink. The chocolate powder contains 15% calcium, 4% vitamin C, 2% iron, and five grams of protein per serving size. Since there are no Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf stores near where I live, it's great to order Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf products online through Amazon or The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's website.

I use half whey protein, half soy protein (since the soy has a tendency to clump, not dissolve, or taste awful if used entirely) and this is just awesome.<br /><br />The taste is mild and milky, not artificial tasting at all. When used entirely it tastes more like a milkshake, not a protein shake. I add a teaspoon (more on some days) of Medaglia D' Oro Instant Espresso Coffee when I make my shakes and the taste of the whey protein totally disappears, so if you don't like the taste you can easily hide it by adding a wide range of flavors. Even adding a cup of vanilla yogurt hides the flavor.<br /><br />It dissolves very well in water, milk, and even soy milk, no clumping whatsoever!<br /><br />This is whey protein in it's simplest form with nothing added, so if you are like me and watch what you put into your body, this is a definite must have pantry item.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great taste (well at least I like it)<br />Dissolves well in a variety of liquids<br />Cooks well without adding any unwanted flavor<br />4g of protein per tablespoon<br /><br />Cons:<br />None!",

However, looking at the image you would imagine them bigger than they ended up being. Cut the lollipop sticks to about half the size you see in that image, and make the actual lollipop part a bit smaller as well. They were fine though. They looked okay, but not the same as the image, that's for sure. Their colors and patterns were slightly different too. This wouldn't be such a big deal, except for the fact that I had spent more getting these than for some other suckers,because I thought these were bigger and better looking. Oh well. They turned out fine in the end. I'm guessing no one looked at them and analyzed how they might be better.",

            "I'll admit, I was skeptical since this tea was sold as a 5-pack at a pretty cheap price. Couldn't possibly be of good quality if they are going to sell bulk for cheap, right? Especially since I was looking for an alternative to Lupicia's Apple Black Tea (which I love, but it gets costly).<br /><br />Just opening the box and smelling the apple scent was convincing enough. The brewed tea has a strong (but not overpowering) Ceylon taste with a slight sweetness of apple. I can imagine if I mixed some sugar and refrigerated this, it would make a really delicious iced tea too.<br /><br />If you like apple black tea, I highly recommend this one. :)",

            "Red beans and rice is such a simple dish.  Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.<p>New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.  <p>The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the &quot;red kidney bean&quot; popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor.<p>Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans.",

            "When I picked up a box of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B00474OR8G >Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!",

I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.",

At least the boxes only have 20 bags, er, sachets, but I'm going to have to use two per cup for the same brew. Also, the box is BIGGER, and each  sachet  is INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED (which will keep it fresher, but is very packaging intensive and wasteful and I would much prefer the non-wrapped bags with no string and tab), and each box only has 20 sachets, each of which has less tea than the original bag style.

They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.",

It's kind of like an Altoids box, but a bit smaller and lighter.<br />These were purchased as a gift, so I can't comment on how they taste. I sure hope they taste more like anise (licorice) than absinthe, though - real absinthe famously tastes so bad that you are supposed to filter it through a sugar-cube and cut it with 3 to 6 parts water before you drink it.",
            "I saw these for the 1st time in Walmart and since I'm a  crafty  type person I visualized different things I could do with these and I ended up making the most adorable  snowmen  to give last Christmas with my cookie boxes.  They were a hit!  I've already started on this years project of making wreaths with them. Everything is edible and they keep very well in the freezer so I'm not in a last minute rush.  They also make great  s'mores!   Like I said, they freeze really well, so I was able to purchase these in bulk at a really good price and be able to use all year.",

So finally I find a company , God bless em, who will ship here ( Hawaiian coffee is quite expensive by the way, especially pure  Kona which can be over $30 lb) and I purchased Eight O'clock Columbian (AH - Light Vienna Roast-not burned beans- and higher in caffeine too) in the largest bag available 42oz ....and it arrived! YEAH! I have only one small complaint which is the shipping cost ...very high ... You can ship items like this via USPS Priority Mail for less than half of what I was charged here and it would have arrived in 3-5 days.

Yes, it's a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Also, we'd like a bag that was resealable (the tin tie at the top tends to wear out before we go through a whole bag).

This Curry is very warming, not too overpowering, not bitter, just right. You can put alot in your recipe if you want, but it still stays Yummy. This kind has never bothered my stomach!

I don't feel like a cheap-o for buying the generic brand, and I won't have to buy more mints this year because I got 12 lbs for about a dollar a pound. For an office setting or small business, this is a a great value.<br /><br />A few points:  These do not look as colorful and rich as Brachs.  They are whiter in appearance, they appear to be wrapped well, and of special interest, they contain only about one third green mints, which I wish was not the case, but it has been true in the two bags I've opened so far.<br /><br />The shipping container was great, well-packed, without any excess space for those of you that are concerned with the environmental aspect.

If you are looking for the subtle taste and firmer texture of the original Delfa Roll you had when you were a kid, forget it.  This will disappoint you.

            "Woodford Reserve has a cult following and it's easy to understand why: it has a lean, semi-dry, aspect that emphasizes herbal and botanical notes and downplays the resiny fruity  candy corn 'aspect one often finds in bourbons. It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18. It's lovely. Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco. There's some leather and cream too. First sip opens bright with honeyed corn. Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect. Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke. It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best. The absence of  corn likker  fruitiness is most appreciated. This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.",

I love pepper so this was a nice surprise over the saltier versions we have tried in the past. There is a slight smoky flavor to it, but doesn't overwhelm the beefiness<br /><br />Price: I bought the 3 oz for $7.00 which seems like a good value and the smaller size gave me the opportunity to try the teriyaki and hot cajun.<br /><br />I will definitely order this again and might try the beef sticks, too.",

If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.  You can use any rice, but basmati is so fragrant that it is what I prefer.

Stir constantly or else it will burn.<br />5. Add carrots and potatoes.  Saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat.  You have to stir very frequently or they will stick/burn.  I do not let anything caramelize.<br />6. Add chicken/yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low.<br />7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through.<br />8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste.<br />9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.

Green peppercorns are picked when under-ripe. White pepper is black pepper which has been soaked to remove the outer husk. Tellicherry peppercorns are the largest black peppercorns.<br /><br />Pink peppercorns are not from the Piper Nigrum vine. They are the dried berries of the Baies rose plant grown on the French island of R&egrave;union and make a colorful addition to sauces.<br /><br />The four peppercorn blend is a favorite for this asparagus dish:<br /><br />Four Peppercorn Asparagus<br /><br />1 bunch fresh asparagus<br />2 tsp. extra virgin olive oil<br />Pinch seasoning salt<br />1/8 tsp. freshly ground four peppercorn blend<br />2 tsp. fresh lemon juice<br /><br />Preheat the oven to 425�F. Arrange asparagus in a 13 X 9 X 2-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with oil, salt, freshly ground pepper, and lemon juice. Bake for 15-20 minutes, turning once.<br /><br />Variation: For a vegetable platter, cook spaghetti squash halves in the microwave for 20 minutes or until done. Boil 20 halved baby red potatoes. Drain potatoes, toss with butter, more freshly ground pepper, salt, and dried parsley. Arrange scooped-out spaghetti squash around the edges of an oval platter. Lay asparagus like the hands of a clock. Fill the middle of platter with potatoes. Drizzle with juices from the asparagus.<br /><br />Makes 4 servings or 6 servings for the platter variation.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

I was actually eying this product for awhile before ordering it because I personally love potatoes.  No salt?  Great.  All organic?  Wonderful!  $2 a can?  Kinda pricy.  But wanted a healthy soup to add to my brown rice.<br /><br />After putting it in the microwave for 3 minutes, which is what I always do with soups, it came out looking like mush and tasted like it also. I have 11 more cans to go through though so bought some hot sauce, going to try chili powder and pepper.  As for the looks, I don't mind so much if it fills me up and healthy for me.<br /><br />The lack of flavor and having to find things to add to it makes it not worth the cost for me.  The killer is, out of the 12 pack, a single can wasn't dented.  The packaging was fine so I doubt they were damaged when shipped.  I also ordered the chicken noodle soup from the same brand, but I haven't tried that yet.  Same problem with the denting.<br /><br />Would I recommend?  Nope.  I'll never order again unless the price drops to $1-$1.50 a can.  Even then, anticipate being creative to make it work for you.  I have 11 more cans to go through.  Personally I'll just stick with steamed veggies on my rice instead of this product.",

            "First off, this did not go over well with our family as a cereal but DID win them over as a Snack mix.  I don't know what the kids were expecting but they didn't like it in milk.  The cereal is no worse than their fave, Bite Sized Chocolate Mini-wheats, so I'm not going to get all self-righteous about the added sugar and all the chocoalte here.  I will say it was a little odd to feel the squish of soft chocolate in your mouth when mixed with the milk.  Rather than toss something that tasted good out, we switched modes and mixed this with rice chex, mini pretzels, unsalted almonds, sunflower seeds and then the KRAVE.  It became a family Snack Fave almost immeditaely.<br /><br />I wish we had a few boxes to try this with so we used coupons and sales to buy some locally and try it again as a SNack with different mixed in non-sugary items.  It seems that no matter what we mixed this with, the Krave was just the right amount of chocolate (loads!) to balance out unsweetened cereals in snack mixes along with some healthy nuts for protein and unsaturated fats.  The key, for us, is portioning. Our family would eat this handful after handful as a mixed snack if we let them so we have to pre-portion it out in reusable tubs with lids.  it goes in lunch boxes and comes out in place of Microwave pocorn when watching a movie.<br /><br />I'd like to see Krave branck out the way that Chex cereals has and offer this in healthy snack bags or better yet, post some snack recipes on their website.  We'll buy it!  The chocolate is creamy and not heard, kinda like Lindt choclate centers while the shell is crunchy like a cereal ought to be.  If you don't mind that in your bowl with milk; you'll love Krave.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/27/12:  When we have seen this on sale and with coupons, we have bought it several times to add to one of the types of Snack Mix we make up by the gallons and store in the old 5 gallon Popcorn tins we've gotten as gifts at Xmas from family.  We put the mix in indivdial, re-usable serving baggies where possible so the kids can just grab one and we know exactly how many calories they've gotten and from what.  The Krave may be a sugary cereal but that melty chocolate middle makes it a good addition to whole grain, unsweetened ingredients such as rolled oats, roasted nuts, Soy nuts and other unsalted crunchies.  it's really all about balance.",

Obviously the previous review is by the manufacturer.",

            "I'm writing about the single serving convenience packs, offered in a 24-count case, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000J05MM2 >OFXW116 Walkers Shortbread Fingers Cookies, 2 Cookies/Pack, 24 Packs/Box</a>, which are also available with Subscribe and Save.  They're amazing!  Here's why:<br /><br />1  Yes, as everyone says, these Walker cookies are exceptional.  You may think it's all just buzz, but if you haven't tried them, don't judge us as silly until you do (!).<br /><br />2  But what happens if you open a box -- you finish it, right!  BAD.  These little suckers aren't the greatest thing for you, to put it mildly.<br /><br />3  Answer:  single serving packaging!!  It really works.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I'd always have a box on hand in case of unexpected guests -- at least, I'd think I had one, but the box would usually have disappeared unexpectedly whenever I went to look for it.  True confessions:  I love them too and was occasionally looking to sneak some for myself!  So having them around just in case was a bad, BAD idea.  But a case of 24 packs of 2 cookies per package is ideal.  Two seems to satisfy my husband's craving -- he almost never takes more than one packet.  And I open a packet occasionally and make 2 cookies last 2 days, instead of a whole box lasting almost forever and my worrying that they'd go stale or attract ants.<br /><br />Bonus:  they're easily packable!  When my husband's expecting an exceptionally tough day at work, I'll usually sneak a pack into his lunch if he hasn't already appropriated one for himself.<br /><br />And when he's especially wiped out at the end of an unusually demanding day, a pack of these really seems to perk him up and help him muster strength for tomorrow.  He brings it upstairs while he's watching TV and waits a while before opening the bag and savoring his treasure.  Whether for lunch or after dinner, the gleam in his eye as he talks about how wonderful it is to have a treat when he's so stressed means a lot to me, especially when I know he's only eating in moderation instead of wolfing down ten or twenty servings at a time.  The case of 24 has lasted us 3 months already -- a pleasant surprise, given that there are 2 addicts in the house.  :  So our portion-control strategy is working!!!<br /><br />And yes, when we had guests who chose after-dinner tea, these were just the right thing to bring out with it, and I didn't mind opening multiple packs at once and putting the cookies together on 1 plate for serving, knowing that I wasn't either spoiling an entire box, or promoting too rapid consumption of it, just by providing our guests with a few.<br /><br />I wish two other treasures came in single-serving packets:  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S >LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8WI1Q >Mary's Gone Crackers, Caraway, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>!!<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.",

These treats simply don't entice him enough to really be a treat.",

            "I just got my shipment today and while to some degree i'm not thrilled with the six separate 3x3 sets, I have to admit they will store in my tool kit much easier being smaller packaging (and take up less very-valuable workspace while working).  I also have to wonder if reordering a specific set of 9 will be easier to replace ones i find frequently useful.  Granted both of these concerns are rather long-term issues, not so much immediate concerns.<br /><br />The reason I so-far give this item 4 stars (and I TOTALLY reserve the right to change my viewpoint) is that they are definitely CAKES of petal dust.  Previously I've worked exclusively with powders, and these cakes do require a bit more work to get the desired amount of dust onto the gumpaste flowers.  As a professional in this industry, however, I feel comfortable knowing that I spent $40+ tax/shipping/etc for 54 colors.  I was at my local hobby store (Michaels) and saw the selection of petal powders by Wilton.  Each individual tube was $4.99 and they only had 10-ish colors for roughly the same amount of petal powder.  This is far more cost effective for producing a variety of flowers for various displays.  And who says I can only make flowers with these dusts?!<br /><br />I'd also like to politely remind anyone using petal-powder style products that these are meant to give your gumpaste work depth and accents, not to entirely color a product.  Using a good reference, you should start your piece with (a leaf, for instance) a yellow or green colored piece of gumpaste and once formed, accent, darken, and shade accordingly with the powders.  Don't expect all the color work to happen with the petal dust on white gumpaste for typical work.",
            "I am extremely dissatisfied with the product and customer service from this company (Barry Farm). It says on the page for this product  Usually ships within 6 to 10 days . I ordered this product over three and a half weeks ago and just received it. I was still charged over $8.00 for shipping (more than the item was worth). I took precautions for the product not to sit in the sun and melt, ordering it so it would be delivered on a day I was home. This effort failed; the shipping and delivery dates changed...twice. I got an email from Amazon stating that they had not received notification of shipping from the seller (Barry Farm). I emailed the seller, received no response. I then got an email from Amazon a day later with a delivery time frame. The product did not arrive during the stated time frame (late). When it finally arrived, I received a bag of melted goo. But the interesting thing was, it was evident that the product had melted before, re-hardened, and then began to melt again in my mailbox. Due care was not taken to package the product in a manner that MAY have helped prevent such damage. I will not be ordering from this company again.",
            "Recently I had the misfortune to fall off a bus--no laughing is allowed.  To make it worse, I had next to no food in my apartment aside from a box of these Taste Adventure Beans, assorted frozen veggies, rice and tortillas.  A co-worker had given the beans to me to try as they hadn't worked for her  project  (a nacho fund raiser).  Thank goodness for the beans.  One can only eat so many bowls of frozen veggies and rice without going nuts.<br /><br />Once I tasted the beans, I was hooked.  The ingredient list is one that I can get behind:  precooked pinto beans and sea salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I now keep a box in my desk at work for those emergency snacks.

They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, and they are gluten free. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />Many reviewers have reported not liking them, but my experience is different. (To be sure, I would try a smaller quantity first and make sure that these are for you.) These are a natural food and they may contain occasional seeds, stems, or core fragments. This doesn't sound good, but I didn't really notice much of anything at all that I couldn't eat or that was hard. These dried pears are very fibrous (like jerky), so you need to have healthy teeth to be able to chew them.

It just doesn't seem to work it's way into our diets often enough. Well, I discovered a way that may get around that problem. While shopping at my local Costco warehouse store, I discovered  a wrapped set of six six-ounce cans of Bear & Wolf Pink Salmon. It's wild Alaskan salmon, packed with a little water and salt, and it's skinless and boneless.<br /><br />I opened up a can when I got home. It has very little  fishy  odor, although my  cats certainly got excited when the top came off the can, and the taste is fresh and mild. Excellent! One of the reviews suggested eating it raw, so that's what I did with a variety of salad veggies. Mmmmm, good. Nice lunch. I'll surely repeat this. Plus the unused portion in the can was easy to cap and return to the fridge. Another suggestion was to put it in casseroles for baking. Of course, I can hardly wait. A scalloped potato dish with salmon ought to be excellent. Or salmon with noodles. I can even take it along as a quality source of protein when I go camping. That's what I like about this product. It's high quality, real handy and easy to store.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",

It tastes kind of like Squirt or other citrus sodas, but lighter with no afterbite. The sugar tastes more authentic and light as they use the more expensive cane sugar instead of the cheap frutose sweetener most soda companies use on us now. The carbonation is a bit lighter as well and not overpowering.<br /><br />Jarritos is now the best selling Mexican soft drink brand in the U.S. The single servings are still sold in glass bottles,  also available here at at Amazon.

            "This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one.

There's no greasy feel or rancid smell. They actually smell pretty good to me and GREAT to the dogs - open the bag & their noses go into overdrive! When finished, there's no evidence left behind (no spots or stains) and the dogs have fresher breath & happy, silly grins.

I came home from work on a Friday evening and was delighted to find that this package had arrived.  I immediately opened the carton and grabbed a sleeve of saltine crackers, so I started the ultimate taste test.  One by one I tried a few drops of each sprinkled on top of a cracker.  Well just after finishing number six (Dave's Ghost Pepper), the wife arrived, walking into the kitchen she looked at me and asked  Why are you crying?  I replied  I can't help it! The world is so cruel ! .<br />In my opinion the best tasting sauces in this assortment are Blair's and Mad Dog 357.  Blair's is probably the mildest in terms of heat and has a sweet almost tomato like flavor.  Mad Dog, a very hot sauce with smoky BBQ type flavor is probably my favorite.  All of these sauces have decent flavor, but with the exception of Mad Dog, the hottest sauces tend to end with a metallic after taste.<br /><br />Absolutely, and without any doubt Dave's Ghost is the hottest of all in this selection.  Although it has a good flavor, it's usefulness is questionable.  I am unable to add enough quantity of it to a dish to impact flavor without raising the heat to almost intolerable levels.<br />This stuff is extremely hot!!",

            "Well i gave my dog one of these, and she puked twice. Soooo needless to say i just threw the rest out.",
            "I love bai! My favorite flavors are pomegranate and dragonfruit, but all the flavors are tasty. The drinks are hearty, healthy and unique. Best served cold. And so cool that bai has found a way to utilize a previously discarded portion of the coffee bean!",
            "I was very happy to see that I could order just the blueberry tea like the tin that came with my iced tea maker, it's the first blueberry tea I've tried and I love it. I ordered the 4 pack tins and I will for sure order it again!!",
            "I have enjoyed this pudding for years, and was glad to find it at Amazon.  Hopefully, they will continue to carry it.",
            "I bought 6 bottles of the 17 oz bottles at a reasonable price. I was hoping for oil that has that fruity olive taste. This brand did not. I will use it for sauteing, but not on salads.",
            "purchase this for a evening dinner guests,they rave about how good they are. Making it a hit with them but i was disappointed as pistachios is my favorite. It is not the company fault it was mine. The Pistachios was salted and i wanted Unsalted but did not looked carefully when i ordered.<br />i wished i could had eaten them as i am on a salt free diet.<br />This won`t stop me from coming back. Thank you........",
            "This product is an excellent solution to one of my pet peeves. I can now use one jelly packet for each slice of toast without the sticky mess of digging jelly from a jar.",
            "I ordered several spices from this company and many were already expired when they arrived.  I would not recommend.",
            "Youtubers from England and the parts of America I have never been to have raved about these Wine Gums for quite awhile but only now did I take it upon myself to buy a few and try them out.  Not only were they delicious, they were also sent quicker than I expected and were very good quality, the package was wrapped efficiently and the rolls themselves were bigger than I expected. I would definitely suggest that others buy from Maynard's if they also like awesome, good quality candy.",
            "As a diabetic I have to be very careful with what I eat.  Low carbs, low sugar and low salt.  This peanut butter is low on all of those...well maybe a little high on salt.  I saw this advertised on the net and decided to buy a jar of it.  THIS STUFF IS GOOD!  It's not really hot, not lethal by any means.  It is just  toasty  enough that you notice it.  It makes great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!  If you like  hot  stuff I recommend this peanut butter.  Beats the hell out of that other stuff on the market that they call  peanut butter .",
            "Can never have enough of these in the cupboard. I typically buy two boxes at once... for each location (ie. work, home). Great for a little snack in between meals or just a healthy snack to nibble on. Can't go wrong with the original granola bar.",
            "These are the only chickpeas I buy. They are fresh, a quick overnight soak makes them nice and plump and I cook them in about 1 hr, salting 15 mins before they are completely cooked. Chickpeas you cook yourself taste almost sweet and Eden's are great. The company does a great job of cleaning these little guys, I rarely, if ever, find stones or similar things after opening the box. Great value on Amazon.",
            "Love this cat food and so does my cat!  It's all natural and healthy with none of the bad additives that commercial food includes.  I have went from Iams to this and am thrilled I made the change!",
            "Good flavor. Take some extra bags to make what I consider to be good tea but the flavor is certainly nice without being too much.",
            "These fruit squeezes are a healthy on the go snack which is invaluable for toddlers",
            "Honey stinger waffles can't be beat for a reasonably low cal pick me up. They are my favorite  in between  in between Pro Bars and Lara Bars. My only criticism is Amazon does not reliably keep them in stock. Love organic honey stinger waffles.",
            "The Brand we Usually got was backordered and then I found this... We were Desperate so I thought I would just Try it and see if Anyone notices!!WOW we LOVED IT!!!!<br />I will Order COUNTRY HARVEST Band from Now on!",
            "I strongly suggest that this become a part of your diet. Tasty stuff. Don't have to screw around too much. ANYTHING you decide to add to it makes it better. You can't mess this one up. Campbell's chicken noodle soup would work great. Lipton's dehydrated soup would be a great addition. I dare you  to<br />screw this stuff up. Tasty, to my my way of thinking.",
            "A 2 pound bag of regular AP flour for $42 is pretty stupid, don't you think? Is it made with real gold?",
            "Beefeater went for profit over the health of our pets. Sad! Gimborn (Pro Treats) are still made in the USA.",
            "This is the best low-carb cold cereal on the market.  Most of them taste like the cardboard box, but this one is actually crunchy and flavorful.",
            "I have been using Olewo carrots and beets for about a year now. The difference in my dogs is like day and night! Their coats are now shiny, luxurious and soft. Color and pigment are vibrant. I love the deep reds and dark blacks on my German Shepherds. Olewo also helps regulate the digestive system and their stools are better than ever. No more anal gland or digestive issues. Very simple to prepare and extremely cost effective as well. To top it all off, Olewo is very palatable and the dogs LOVE the taste. Bowls are licked clean after Olewo!",
            "Absolutely delicious! I have tried four different varieties and cannot tell the difference between this and regular jam.  My son and I both love it and we both get a little fiber boost when we have toast and jam.  Just wish it was a bit more affordable here on Amazon.",
            "This is my second order and still the best price I can find on Roma. Yeah, I have to store a couple extra bottles but so what."

Since the reviews within these products are correlated,\nwe recommend resampling the data using a leave-one-product-out approach. The\ntest set sampled 500 products that were not included in the training set\nand selected a single review at random for each.\n</p>\n<p>There is a column for the product, a column for the text of the review, and\na factor column for a class variable. The outcome is whether the reviewer\ngave the product a 5-star rating or not.\n</p>\n<h3>Value</h3>\n<table>\n<tr><td><code>training_data</code>, <code>testing_data</code></td>\n<td>\n<p>tibbles</p>\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html\n</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<pre><code class='language-R'>data(small_fine_foods)\nstr(training_data)\nstr(testing_data)\n</code></pre>\n</main>\n</div>\n"
