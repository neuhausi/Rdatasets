The data span a period of more than 10\nyears, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include\nproduct and user information, ratings, and a plaintext review.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>A subset of the data are contained here and are split into a training and\ntest set. The training set sampled 10 products and retained all of their\nindividual reviews. Since the reviews within these products are correlated,\nwe recommend resampling the data using a leave-one-product-out approach. The\ntest set sampled 500 products that were not included in the training set\nand selected a single review at random for each.\n</p>\n<p>There is a column for the product, a column for the text of the review, and\na factor column for a class variable. The outcome is whether the reviewer\ngave the product a 5-star rating or not.\n</p>\n<h3>Value</h3>\n<table>\n<tr><td><code>training_data</code>, <code>testing_data</code></td>\n<td>\n<p>tibbles</p>\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html\n</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<pre><code class='language-R'>data(small_fine_foods)\nstr(training_data)\nstr(testing_data)\n</code></pre>\n</main>\n</div>\n",

            "I have been a consumer of Snyders hard sourdough pretzels for over 12 years.  For a while I could find them locally however,  It seems that they just disappeared for unknown reason.  I wanted to have those baked sourdough twists and I had to settle for another brand.  They were no where near as good as Snyders.<br />My wife who is an employee at Amazon said to try online there,  I did and walla' there they werein a box of 12, that was great and they were even at a reduced cost.  Thanks",
            "This tastes so bad, I'm considering throwing it away.  But I'll probably punish myself for buying 3 boxes of 18 pods by watering down by mixing each with one medium roast Senseo pod for my second cup of coffee each day until they're gone. Don't punish yourself. Just don't buy it.",

            "This thing is 7 dollars in US?I know its exported from Cyprus(its Cypriot,from the Greek Cypriots,not strictly Greek),so the selling price went that high.Anyway this is not even a traditional village halloumi but a factory halloumi and its not even the best brand,so in no way it is worth that much(in my country is somewhere between 1 dollar-Am Cypriot)for a factory Halloumi.If you try the traditional Halloumi from villages you will understand.I laughed at the selling price.",

I have read many reviews regarding dented cans from Amazon, but do not know if Amazon gets them dented, therefore can sell them for less. They were still wrapped individually so would appear they were packed dented.",
            "This is one of my favorite teas. This tea is very light, but still is a great morning pick-me-up. The orange and lemongrass balance so well with the black tea that this tea does not need anything added like milk or sweetener. This is definitely a tea I will always keep in stock.",

            "I grew up in a family of tea drinkers; and although I now tend to have a lot of coffee while I'm at work, I still drink almost exclusively tea when I'm at home. I generally prefer loose leaf teas - that way I know I'll get  the real thing,  whereas tea bags tend to contain merely the leftovers of a harvest; little crumbs too poor in aromatic and other content to otherwise pass quality control standards.<br /><br />The exception are Bigelow teas: and first and foremost among those their flagship, Ruth Bigelow's original  Constant Comment  with its recipe of black tea, orange grind and holiday spices (primarily cinnamon). Created by Mrs. Bigelow on the basis of an old colonial recipe over half a century ago, the blend soon became so popular among her friends that their  constant comments  of approval prompted Ruth and husband David Bigelow to found their own tea company. Since then,  Constant Comment  has long become a true classic ... and if you love tea, it is indeed the perfect refreshment; whether or not it's Christmas time. (E.g., it also makes for great iced tea in summer; particularly if you add a bit of lemon.)<br /><br />If you're making more than a single cup of tea, and unless you like your tea *very* weak, you may want to rethink the company's measuring directions - based on the the  one bag per cup  ratio, you'll likely need two or more bags for an entire pot (depending on size), even when steeping an extra minute or two. That said, though ... wanna come over for a cuppa?",

            "I bought the Everlasting Treat Ball (Large sized) for my 45 lb mixed breed dog, who is an aggressive chewer. This is the same dog that went through a red Kong in a day, and a Kong Extreme in a few months, and will liquefy any tennis ball in seconds. I heard great reviews on this and read about it in a book as well, and after MONTHS of debate decided to pick this up at my local pet store when it was on sale. I just gave it to her less than 20 minutes ago and she already has several chunks out of it.<br /><br />It did  challenge  her for a few minutes, as I put kibble and treats inside. She got the disk out in a few minutes and enjoyed that (chicken flavor) then went crazy getting at the food inside. So crazy, that she has taken several chunks out of the plastic already. And eaten them. Great. She did seem to have fun rolling it around getting the food out, but then went to chewing on the plastic.<br /><br />For a replacement, I got the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0009YHTYC >Everlasting Fun Ball Large</a> in large from the same company- and its been over a week so far and she loves that toy!!! Its basically the same thing as this instead it is actually a green ball with more room for treats inside, and made of more durable material. Also, unlike the treat ball, it does not have any ridges for my dog to bite into and rip pieces off. And, its a bit cheaper. I'm writing this after I've had that ball for at least 6 months, and she plays with it EVERY DAY and there isn't even a mark in the thing.<br /><br />So, all in all, skip this and go for the FUN BALL instead!!!",

            "ICV D-47<br />Saccharomyces cerevisiae<br /><br />Origin<br />This strain was isolated from grapes grown in the C�tes-du-Rh�ne region of France by Dr. Dominique Delteil, head of the Microbiology Department, Institut coop&eacute;ratif du vin (ICV), in Montpellier. ICV D-47 strain was selected from 450 isolates collected between 1986 and 1990.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The ICV D-47 is a low-foaming quick fermenter that settles well, forming a compact lees at the end of fermentation. This strain tolerates fermentation temperatures ranging from 15� to 20�C (59� to 68�F) and enhances mouthfeel due to complex carbohydrates. Malolactic fermentation proceeds well in wine made with ICV D-47.<br /><br />Recommended for making wines from white varieties such as Chardonnay and ros&eacute; wines. An excellent choice for producing mead, however be sure to supplement with yeast nutrients, especially usable nitrogen.<br /><br />An excellent choice for dry whites, blush wines and residual sugar wines.",
            "First, let me point out that you should get 2 bottles of this oil and it is NOT  light  olive oil.  It is extra virgin and organic.  The taste is smooth with a bit of peppery finish.  It is certainly a bit pricey so I am not using it as a general cooking oil.  I use it for salads, drizzling on tomatoes and broiling, and if I ate bread, I'd mix this with garlic and herbs and black pepper--YUM!  Hope you enjoy it :)<br />By the way, when I got my order, it only had one bottle and as I bought it thinking it was  light , I was really disappointed.  But the customer service from Baker's Box was excellent.  They let me keep the bottle and refunded my money, since it is not the product as advertised.",
            "I have used  crystal  type litter for several years now and they are absolutely fantastic. There is absolutely no smell or dealing with urine clumps and whatnot. In my experience, all crystal litter has performed in this manner.<br /><br />I used to use PETCO brand crystal litter. This is a great litter but the rocks are big and often got stuck between my cats paws and would be dragged into the room (or at the very least all around the outside of his litter box). These Micro-Crystals are far superior to the petco litter at the same price point.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Very fine litter, does not get stuck in my cats paws or spread anywhere (In fact, I have not seen ANY of it spill outside his box yet and I have been using it for roughly 3 weeks)<br />-NO smell<br />-Once a month; just scoop the poop don't worry about the urine at all until you swap the whole thing out.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Dusty when the cat uses it or when changing it out (due to how fine the crystals are)<br />**This is a minor problem because I keep my litter box next to my toilet (easily scoop the poop) so if I go into the bathroom right after my cat, it is a little dusty. It settles very fast though (a minute or so is plenty to wait)<br /><br />Overall, I definitely would recommend these as the #1 type of cat litter I have ever used. I have had cats for over 20 years and am exclusively switching to these. The ONLY issue I have seen with them is the dust that is kicked up after my cat uses the box, but this settles so quickly it is not an issue.",

            "<span class= tiny > Length:: 9:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>While this review features the book, COCONUT OIL MIRACLE, it displays and describes other products [including coconut oil] which that book catalyzed into a healing synergy. I've reviewed most of the products shown in this video.<br /><br />Johanna Galt, thank you for your comment and question posted under the original written review I had submitted here, which I've deleted and replaced with this video [6/25/10]. Most of the content below was written in response to your question.<br /><br />I had purchased this brand a few years ago, and to be honest, I don't recall much about the flavor.  It was my first experience cooking with coconut oil, and I hadn't yet read any books on it.  The brands I've used recently and favor most for quality, aroma, and flavor are:<br /><br />EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz.<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B001EO5Q64 >Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Both of those brands, from my experience, are excellent quality.<br /><br />When I read <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049 >The Coconut Oil Miracle (by Bruce Fife)</a> I learned a greater variety of uses of the oil and how to work with its relatively hard texture.  I had kept it in the refrigerator until I read Fife's book and learned the oil [if it's in good condition when purchased] could be safely kept in the cupboard, usually for a year or more.  There's lots of interesting, valuable information in that book, which helped me conveniently expand my usage of this miracle oil.<br /><br />I had recently read the later reviews on this NOW Foods offering and had felt that possibly I was lucky to get a better quality batch than some of those reviewers, because I don't recall the oil tasting off.  But after reading those reviews and experiencing what might be higher quality products [linked above], I will probably stay with EFAGold or Nutiva, but I'm curious enough to try the NOW Foods product on this page again for flavor and purity comparison, in case the poor reviews came from an uncommon occurrence of a bad batch of the product.<br /><br />The EFAGold jar I received seemed to be of slightly higher quality, but Nutiva is very near as good, and sometimes priced more economically.  The information on some of the Amazon product pages for Nutiva is interesting, very helpful, and impressive.  I'm now cooking so much with the oil that I bought the larger size, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz.  But I will also keep the 15 oz jars, as they're convenient to take with me away from home.<br /><br />To be fair, I should buy this NOW brand again to compare it to these others which I've experienced.  I've used other NOW Foods products and have been pleased with them.<br /><br />I've noticed additional brands available on Amazon which look good, too.  From the information in Fife's book, I might try any oil which is cold pressed [ANH, absolutely no heat] and extra virgin.<br /><br />I LOVE cooking with coconut oil.  It seems to me to enhance the integrity of the flavor of the food it's used with, and the savory flavor of beef steaks and other stronger meats can be furthered and the coconut edge removed by use of garlic, onions, and salty spices added to the oil when cooking.<br /><br />Some of my reviews on the above linked product pages give different information from this one, and hopefully more helpful written information from the original one which had been posted here.  In view of some of the comments and the collected  NO  votes on that review, I decided to post this video, to delete the original written review, and plan to include a copy of it at the end of the first 6 comments which had been made on the original review.<br /><br />May pleasant aromas follow your nose,<br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />NOTE: If you have a magnesium deficiency like many people are experiencing now, feel free to read some of my reviews on magnesium products for information about ways to retain that index mineral into your system at adequate levels.  Most coconut oil has a lot of potassium in it, which can replace some of the needed magnesium.",
            "I am an avid Earl Grey tea drinker (about 4 cups/day) and generally prefer loose tea.  Without realizing the vendor I choose to give this product a try.  Tea is not too bad, perhaps a bit bland, but not so weak as to warrent two bags per cup. Tea is no worse than Twinings or other mass market products, certainly drinkable and packets are portable and simple to use.  This is no where near the caliber of most loose teas.  One product I do recommend is Kusmi Anastasia tea.<br /><br />As a footnote, I would warn you against purchasing loose tea from Tea District.  I generally purchase by the pound and ordered a pound of tea before I was in dire need of a refill.  After it arrived I stored it in my dry cool basement until it was needed.  In the time it took me to finish my current batch, the tea district tea spoiled - the sealed mylar bag smelled of spoiled oranges or rotten feet or maybe both.  Tasted about as bad too.  Company told me I waited more than 30 days to complain so it's my problem.  Wasn't cheap and wasn't consumable.  If you're looking at loose tea from Tea District, purchase small sample bags not the large sealed bags or better yet, look elsewhere.",

            "What an outstanding product!  Fresh, clean, packed in one of those easy-to-reseal bags.  The apricots are very, very tasty and flavorful.  The fruit is a little darker than the sulfurated variety but much, much softer and easier to eat.  This is a FIRST CLASS product, unadulterated with any chemicals or preservatives.  A good source of all-natural vitamins and minerals, especially iron.  WMD",

            "I was looking for that extra something as a joint gift to my grandparents. I got them individual gifts but it did not seem enough so I got this for them as well. When they opened it they seemed excited about the gift and looking forward to seeing the contents. I then asked them later how they liked it and my grandmother said it was no good and the candy was stale. Well that was embarassing. I love buying Christmas presents and finding unique and fun things for my loved ones. I dont get to do a lot for my family normally like most people on a tight budget. I feel let down by the company and sad that the point of the gift wasn't able to be achieved. I would not buy this again and would sadly not be able to recommend it. I think it is a neat idea but the quality of the candy was no good.",

They lived their 9 months in a room w/o windows and not much human contact at a shelter, and although we've had them almost a year now, one of them is still very shy.  These treats kind of opened him up and now he comes to his name and allows you to pet him when given his shrimp.  All I have to do is shake the bag and say  shrimp  and he comes running.  No other treat has done that for us!",
            "The first reviewer complains that this is not 100% Cherry Juice and that the provider is lying.  When I buy a product that has Cherry and Grape in the name, my expectation is not that it is 100% Cherry with no other fruit juices.  I would carefully analyze all the facts before I resorted to accusing anyone or any company of lying.  (I do not work for Welchs, sell their product, or own stock.)<br /><br />I have gout and depend on natural products that can help me.  I have never had the positive results that others have had from eating fresh cherries and drinking cherry juice.  But, this beverage seems to help.  I suspect the secret is in the grape seed extract.  This is a by product of wine making and is reportedly very high in antioxidants.  It is one of the few products that contains grape seed extract.  I may try the grape seed extract as a stand-alone nutrient in the future to determine if that is the trick.<br /><br />BTW - The beverage is delicious.  I really enjoy my daily refreshment with this product.",

            "I have made macaroni and cheese using this pasta several times and am now hooked.  One thing I must say is that it is IMPERATIVE that the water for the pasta be in a full boil before adding the pasta to the water -- otherwise you end up with a slimy slush.  Other than that, the only other things to worry about are a)overcooking and b)overeating.<br /><br />For leftovers, the pasta dish must be covered and thoroughly reheated until very hot, else the pasta will be leathery.  If you find the reheated pasta is like leather, you just need to cover and microwave a little longer.<br /><br />IMO this pasta tastes *better* than non GF versions -- and it had better, given the price, right?  Even so, I've taken off one star for the price because these are SO much more expensive than the non GF version (which can be purchased for 1/3 the price per unit...as in 99 cents).  However perhaps this might explain the expense -- the box containing the bags of pasta was marked  Product of Italy .",
            "I have two kids with food allergies so I am very limited to what I can use in the house. Between two of them, we can't have milk, eggs, soy, wheat, nuts, and corn. So what is left?? only rice milk (well, I tried oat, sunflower, hemp, etc but I could not get used to the taste). I usually buy rice milk from refridgerated section at the supermarket. I needed poweder milk to use for baking and to mix with my coffee. When you mix this powder with any liquid, it does not disolve well and you have to mix it very well. I usually have to use a back of spoon against a cup and stir multiple times. Other than that, the task is good (well it is not like MILK, as you know) and it does give choices to people with food allergies. So, I really appreciated that they came up with this product. If you can take regular milk, you might want to stick with milk. But if you have food allergies, this is a good alernative product to purchase.",
            "I was a little hesitant about the instructions for cooking this mix when I first opened up the package; I didnt think it would be ready in the time they gave (5 minutes of boiling & then removing the pot from the burner and leaving it covered for 1/2 an hour). I added a mixture of chicken & fish and was pleasantly surprised when I lifted the lid to my pot and saw that the jambalaya was ready to eat! I'm definitely ordering this mix again!<br /><br />A word of caution! They mix was a little spicy. I love spicy food so it wasnt a problem for me but some people may find it a little to hot for their taste.",

I had already been buying Three Dog Bakery treats for her (which she LOVES!!)and so after exhausting every other idea trying to get her to eat her food, I picked up a few of these.  I mixed a little in with her dry food and she scarfed it right down and begged for more!! I decided to switch to their dry food as well and my dog couldn't be happier.  She enjoys her meal time so much more, when before she would actually crawl off and hide.  She is a spoiled little Jack Russell Terrier, but I wouldn't have it any other way.",
            "I have 3 different flavors on these and they are : jalape&ntilde;o , apple wood ,a and hickory. I so far think hickory has the best smoke taste but apple wood has more bacon flavor. Jalape&ntilde;o is good but not the best . All these products do and will add complex flavor to your food. They add great smoke and subtle bacon flavor. You can smell the bacon and taste it on most foods. I think it is the best on chicken. I disagree with the people that say there is hardly any bacon flavor and I think you guys have poor palates. Do not expect this to make your food taste like it was wrapped by 90 pieces of bacon for Pete's sake! No seasoning is meant to achieve this level of flavor and if you want full bacon taste then buy bacon and eat it! But JD's bacon products are amazing and my wife and I love it on most BBQ meats and I like to add it to chili's and anything you wish to add extra flavor to. Highly recomended and it will always be in my spice cupboard .",

So you're getting 36 1 oz pouches.<br /><br />I've tried the other Somersault flavors and enjoy them all, but these are easily my favorite.

            "Ordered the Acana Ranchlands because of the reviews that I saw on various websites.  The dog (Miniature Poodle) liked it so-so, and then the worst part was his stool became really, really (!!) HARD on this food.  Tried other Acana varities (e.g., Grasslands) - and had the same result.  He was nearly constipated on the Acana and had a very tough time trying to pass a stool.  Then the stool itself had a very hard consistency - not at all normal.<br /><br />So, for the money, I would say pass this up and go for something else!!  We've switched to Taste of the Wild (which is also grain free) and are finding that the dog loves it as much - if not more - and aren't having any of the stool issues that we did with Acana.",

            "Rao's is famous for their marinara sauce, and justifiably so.  It has a freshness and authenticity that I've not found in any other packaged sauce, and works well on its own or as a base (I like to add canned clams for a quick red clam sauce).<br /><br />But, the Italian Sausage and Mushroom takes the Rao's tradition of flavor and quality in a new and wonderful direction.  Rather than a simple red sauce, this sauce has complex flavors, with the savory mushrooms and sweet Italian sausage mixing well with fresh herbs in a rich red base.  Rao's bills this sauce as  Dinner to Go,  and that's fair.  You really don't need to do anything to it -- just heat it up and serve over some good quality pasta with some good grated cheese.<br /><br />My local grocer used to carry this sauce, and I was very disappointed when they dropped it from their lineup of Rao's sauces.  Until I can get them to put it back on the shelf, I guess it will be mail order for me!",

They also love this food and the ingredients are very good for them. I've started feeding them grain free foods for the past year or so since one of the dogs has bad allergies. But most grain free foods contain white potatoes which are very high carbohydrate. The allergic dog can tend to overweight so I also try to limit her carbohydrate intake. Zeal is one of the lowest carbohydrate foods HK makes. The food is very easy to re-hydrate. Just add equal amounts of food and water, stir, and wait 5-10 minutes. That 5-10 minutes is sheer torture for my dogs as they sit at the base of the cabinet and stare up at their bowls.",

Until recently I was used to having a Diet Coke each morning, but wasn't really thrilled about the chemicals that diet soda packs. I was already a fan of the V8 Fusion drinks, so when I found out about V-8's Fusion + Energy drinks, I was thrilled to have a better option available.<br /><br />Unlike the 100% juice V8 Fusion drinks, the V8 Fusion + Energy drinks combine the fruit and vegetable juices with green tea, so you get a hefty dose of caffeine in addition to a full serving of fruits and veggies (and the vitamins that come with it) in one 50-calorie serving. The green tea does alter the taste quite a lot from the non-caffeinated V8 Fusion drinks, but it's still pretty tasty, especially the Peach Mango flavor.<br /><br />One thing that's worth pointing out is that this little can has quite a bit more caffeine than a can of diet soda, so you may need to modify the amount of caffeine you take in later in the day. Most of the time, one can has all the caffeine I need for the day.<br /><br />These V8 Fusion + Energy drinks are a great tasting, and mostly healthy, alternative to diet sodas as well as the crazy chemical/stimulant concoctions like Red Bull and Monster. If you've got to have that caffeine fix, you might as well get some vitamins with it!",

Like the Butterfingers do, Clark bars stick to your teeth.  But the Clark bars seem to be a little bit lighter and flakier then Butterfingers, so they're easier to get off of your teeth.

It has a unique flavor that does remind one of coffee. It is especially aromatic and quite different from the other meat rubs I have tried; both store bought and homemade. Since then, I have used it again on strip steaks, allowing it to work its way into the meat for at least 4 hours before grilling. I did try it on St. Louis Pork Ribs and didn't really care for the flavor combination.

            "I found these for sale at Wal-Mart, and I would recommend getting them there unless an online price changes and happens to out do the convenience of buying local.  For 24 bottles I paid about $30.<br /><br />Onward to the product review.<br /><br />So I have been using these off and on since our baby boy was born in the hospital, where they supplemented him using this product while his mothers breast milk came in.  Today almost a month later we are still using this product.<br /><br />I have had some mixed results with this product, causing my son to have some gas, reflux, spit-ups, and rare vomiting (although not exclusively Enfamil's fault), but for the most part he seems to keep this down and enjoy it.  It also seems to mix fairly friendly with his moms breast milk, so if my boy is really hungry I can confidently give him both and not cause issue.<br /><br />If you can get around the price, reason with yourself, because let me tell you how convenient this product really is: The product comes in a ready-to-go bottle, and all you have to do is attach a screw-on nipple.  This is perfect for when you are up at 3AM feeding your baby (when you are tired as hell) and you have no breast milk around, or when you're out and about and you just want to quickly feed your baby.<br /><br />I have had great success using this product with my son versus using another powdered make-it-yourself product, wherein my baby was much more pleased to drink and digest this product from the latter.<br /><br />The shelf life is pretty good because you can keep this bottle out at room temperature for an hour, and store it in the refrigerator for about 2 hours or so.  Honestly, that's great because it is often the case that your baby is going to drink the entire bottle or close to it when you start your feeding anyway.<br /><br />So although the price is not as cheap as some others... the convenience factor, paired with the amount per bottle for a feeding, really makes this product worth it.  This is the only formula product I buy my son at the moment, and it seems to be working quite well.",

            "I have bought cases and cases of this stuff over the years.  I am really shocked at how watered-down this product has become.  I thought it was me just getting used to it, but it is not.  I have become very frustrated with Torani's tampering with and reformulating their syrups.  Even compared to their  sugar-ful  syrup, I find that I have to use almost twice as much of this product.  I have found a similar story with other Torani Sugar-Free syrups.  It seems they are making up for the trivial cost of the artificial sweetener and giving you less.<br /><br />As a result, I have been trying many other sugar-free (and sugar-ful) syrups -- and spending a lot, too.  In comparison, Monin O'Free chocolate syrup is roughly 2X as flavorful/concentrated, but sadly, it is about 2X as much cost.  Plus, you may have to pay S/H.  While the Torani flavor is pretty good (slight chemical taste), the Monin is a bit malty, so I would give the Torani the edge.  I have also tried DaVinci's sugar-free chocolate syrup.  It probably has the best taste, but like Torani, it is watered down.  DaVinci's is a bit more on the bittersweet side.  At twice the cost, however, it is hard to justify when a bottle only lasts about a week (> $1 per big mug of coffee).<br /><br />Hopefully, others can post what good sugar-free syrups they find.

Enjoy! :)",

So I rushed onto Amazon & found them, and thought  Wow, $30 is a steal for 60 huge lollipops!  Long story short, my box arrived today and deceived me with it's heaviness. There's actually only 30 lollipops in the box. That's not bad, considering they're approximately $1/pop, but I'll have to really think hard about my friendships and ask myself,  Should I really share a lolly with this this person? Are they that important to me?  Probably not! :)",

The actual product looks somewhat darker than the example picture, and the quality is not quite as consistent as what I can get at my local WholeFoods.  I estimate that 90-95% of the dried mango tasted excellent, however 5-10% was dry and brittle, and lacked sweetness.<br />If you can't obtain good dried organic mango locally this a good deal, but think I'll pay the extra $5 and get it from WholeFoods since there I can also select which pieces I want.",

I will buy other gum as well so I don't get<br />sick of this gum.",
            "This is not my favorite Peet's coffee blend, but it is my favorite of the offerings here at Amazon.  It is also my favorite of those blends offered at retail grocery stores.<br /><br />What I like most about it is its versatility.  We used this blend to experiment with our new single-serve coffee maker, the Jura Ena Micro 1.  This is basically an espresso maker, but it can make several strengths, and besides espresso shots, it makes ristretto and lungo cups also. We found the Major Dickason's Blend to taste rich and full-flavored made as an intense shot and also as a milder 12 oz. regular cup of coffee. Can't get much better than that!  For a coffee to provide a great brew at many different strengths is a real plus.<br /><br />Be aware that this coffee is offered in both 12 and 16 ounce bags--and the bags look alike, so do your math before asssuming one bag is cheaper than another.  I'm so glad to see Peet's products offered here at Amazon.  Peet's products are always top-notch and very fresh.  Their coffee and tea buyers really know what they are doing.",

            "You can still get more flavor in a fully caffeinated green tea, but this is green, clean, and refreshing. It is not at all bitter as long as you pull the tea bag out in 1-2 min, and it has forgiven longer steeps as well. The flavor is warm and mellow with some grassy tones, but the grassy tones are not overwhelming. Light, all-day tea that's good cold as well. I'll sometimes put a bag into cold or room-temperature tea to flavor the water deliciously without adding heat to a summer day.<br /><br />I often mix this with other flavors to cut the caffeine in half, or mix it with other decaf flavors (like herbal mint) for variation.",

Remove the top half or so of popcorn to a second bowl and repeat the seasoning process.  With a Misto or small perfume type sprayer, I can get down to as little as one teaspoon of oil and 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning per 2 quart batch of popcorn.<br /><br />It also works great on baked potatoes.  My rankings:<br /><br />1. Parmesan/garlic<br />2. Tie for sour cream and onion with ranch<br />4. Tie for nacho cheese and white cheddar<br />6. Butter<br />7. Barbeque - still good, but grind is coarser, lack of salt requires double the amount of seasoning.",

            "These are great ice-cool mints with a sweet peppermint flavor.  They don't sting or assault your senses, but they do freshen your breath. They are a little stronger than the generic white and red peppermint hard-candies that restaurants set out in bowls, and these give you a nice cool sensation like a york or junior mint. As these mints age (say a year), they also mellow.<br /><br />With so much mint gum, it's hard to find a good mint tablet.  Many alternatives have caffeine, crunchy shells, or are uncomfortably intense.  Not these. They are just perfectly balanced.<br /><br />I stumbled across these mints about two years ago on a 3000 mile road trip.  Since then, I've purchased several 9-pack boxes.  I've never seen these at stores since my original purchase.  Dentyne has a companion flavor to these  ICE  mints, called Fire. I have seen the fire mints in stores.<br /><br />As far as use, I keep these between my bed and bathroom.  I used to have a habit of waking up hungry and  sleep-eating  when I'd get up to use the bathroom.  I've retrained myself to grab a mint instead.  Since they are sugar free, they don't rot my teeth.  And, since they aren't too strong... they don't wake me up too much.  I just suck on the mint until I fall back to sleep.",
            "I love my Sodastream and primarily use it to create sparkly water or flavored water with the unsweetened, all-natural essences. But sometimes a girl wants a bit more flavor.<br /><br />Enter Root Beer Natural.<br /><br />To start, it's made from cane sugar; which I prefer to corn syrup or Splenda and it doesn't have any additional artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. As previously mentioned, the root beer taste is not knock-you-over intense, but with the Sodastream, I can adjust it to the exact water/flavor mix I want! If you're looking for a very strong root beer taste, I'd recommend Virgil or Boylan. They're sold in bottles and are both VERY strong!<br /><br />Second, each 750ml bottle will make 6 liters (approximately 25 8-oz servings) of all-natural soda. At $15, this is far cheaper than the other natural sodas you find at the store (Blue Sky, Thomas Kemper, Hansen, etc).<br /><br />I prefer this natural root beer to the other soda flavors I've tried from Sodastream and will buy it again!",

This however had just the right amount of sweetness and flavor that they worked together perfectly.  So far, I have used this in my dark chocolate mochas which are wonderful! I love how Amoretti Syrups are sweet enough (or for me that is)that you do not need to add any sugar to your drink because that is already taken care of.<br /><br />I have bought/received a whole variety of Amoretti Syrups (friends say that it looks like I have my own coffee shop!)and cannot wait to try other flavors.

Flavor-wise it tastes just like the Cherry Pie Lara bar plus a handful of nuts (almonds, pecans, and cashews.  For my taste, I was too sweet, which is strange considering that I was craving a sweet snack and normally sweet is just my thing.  The fat grams (12!!) are just not worth it for me.  I'd rather have a simpler nut bar...or a slice of actual Cherry Cobbler!  Hmmm. bottom line:  If you're a fan of the Cherry Pie Lara Bar and want some added nuts, this will likely be perfect for you.",

I had to put it in the freezer to give it any firmness at all.  That alone makes it entirly unappealing as I feel like I am squishing a pureed form of fat in my mouth.  The flavor is not too bad, but it is pretty clearly all artificial.  I would highly recomend avoiding this product and go with another brand.  I would rate this zero stars if I could but 1 star was as low as it would go.",

They have sooo much more flavor than the regular cheddar bunnies. We would love to see these get a little wider distribution. Most of the major chains carry the cheddar bunnies, but none carry these delicious crackers. We cannot find them anywhere in North Houston and have to buy them by the dozen on Amazon--which really isn't so bad since we get a little savings in the process. And we know we don't have to worry about them all getting eaten!",

I don't like when they do 80% cocoa and its just no fun any more, all bitter.<br /><br />This is now my all time favorite dark chocolate bar. There are complexities in this Blanxart bar, a little smokiness, a little bitter but in great balance with a little sweetness. I highly recommend it I you like dark but not crazy bitter chocolate. Dips nicely with a little peanut butter :) good for rationing out in small but satisfying doses.",

There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.",

It's not a bad thing to get if you just got a Keurig and are trying to pick your favorite coffees. You're probably not going to like everything, but you can definitely taste the difference between roasts and flavors. Also, having more than one sample of each lets you try different brew sizes. However, for my sampler pack, they repackaged the hundred K-cups into a box labeled  80 K-cups, Hazelnut.  My first reaction was that I had received the wrong item. On closer inspection, I saw it was relabeled as a hundred pack. I wouldn't purchase this if I knew what I liked, but for the first K-cup purchase for the new machine, it was a big win.",

If you count each square and only eat the # of sqaures that = 1 serving, you won't get fat and the leftover bits in the bottom make a nice addition to whole grain hot cereals or to homemade chex mix.  My wife eats this stuff as a filling, protein & fiber rich snack or even as part of her lunch with fruit and  a salad of dark greens & veggies.  It doesn't spike her blood sugar ( she has to watch hers since it swings very low and very high).  Also, when she's feeling a low blood sugar headache coming on, she reaches into her purse and eats either half or a whole a serving of this  very vasic snack with some water for fast relief.<br /><br />The genius is in the uniformity of the squares for portion control.  If you count them  and only eat 6 generously sized pieces, you will only get  156 calories, 3 grams of sugar and  5 et carbs when you subtract the fiber (fiber has to be listed as a carb by law).  Once you get used to the amount,  you can figure out how much of the fallen odd bits in the bottom equal 1 serving or do what we do and toss it in with some non-sugar ceareal and a little bit of Cinnamon toast crunch so the kids will have a  sweet Snack  that ain't actually as sweet as they imagine it is!  (we're sneaky parents! oh noes!)  To get this  semi-sweet sback mix,  we mix 2/3'rds  wheat chex & generic rice krisps with 1/3 Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, shake that up with the leftover broken off bits of toasted almonds from 2 large bags of Mr's Mays Almond crunch, right inside the Mr.s May's Re-sealable bags,  and we get a nice snack we can dole out in 1 cup servings.  You can stretch this mix even further by adding air-popped popcorn and handing it out in kid decorated  popcorn bags  made from grocery store bags and have a nice family movie night complete with a less sinful snack.  Just be sure and scoop up from the bottom to get some of those heart-healthy almonds in your  portion  since the almonds have a way of hading at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I realize I sound a lot like  Mr. Snack Hacker  here on Amazon but in these times of rising food prices it would be shameful to let any part of a healthy snack go to waste and often times just by mixing up something new from something they've had before can re-interest kids in a healthy snack.  If being creative is what it takes to prevent food waste, I'm proud to be a Snack Hacker!",

            "I've been planning on trying Starbucks instant coffee for some time now. I'm a firm believer in trying something before committing. But the $3300 price tag on this was going to be a pretty big financial hit, especially after having been laid off from my job as a product tester at the chloroform plant. As you can probably imagine, I get into a lot of car accidents, and my old Pinto was once again in serious need of repairs.<br /><br />So I was stuck. Do I take out a loan to buy a new fender and Nomex shell for my Pinto, or use the money to enjoy the rich taste of fine Colombian coffee, hoping that the caffeine boost will avert yet another school crossing tragedy?<br /><br />Thankfully, once again Amazon has come to the rescue! The new ridiculously low price of $2.49 (that's 99.9256% off!) is practically charity! It's also literally a lifesaver! I never dreamed that I'd live in a world where I could both afford to get the dents and blood stains off of my car *and* enjoy a good cup of coffee! It's like living in a utopia! Now if I can just find another well-paying job inhaling dangerous chemicals then I won't have to keep hiding from the police and the bank's loan officers! Well, I might still have to hide from the police, but you get the idea. Thanks, Amazon and Starbucks!",
            "I was really looking forward to these candies--the description online sounded excellent, and I have been looking for another corn-syrup free, vegetarian candy in addition to the Surf Sweets ones I currently purchase. These are advertised online as  contains no high fructose corn syrup  and the list of ingredients did not contain corn syrup (they were listed as  Glucose syrup; sugar; modified corn starch; Acidulants: malic acid, citric acid; Gelling agent: Gellan; flavours; Acidity regulator: trisodium citrate; Concentrates of fruits and plants (orange, elderberry, lemon, aronia, black currant, apple, kiwi, spinach, nettle); elderberry extract; fructose; invert sugar syrup. )<br /><br />When I ripped open the first package, the first bite was amazing, but the constancy seemed to be too perfect, so I immediately checked the ingredients.  Imagine my surprise to see that the very first ingredient listed was . . . drumroll please . . . CORN SYRUP. While I know that some might argue that corn syrup and high fructose syrup are distinct, the fact remains that corn syrup was not listed on the website, and that taken along with the  no high fructose corn syrup  would imply that there was no corn syrup in the candy.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, the candies were actually pretty good, but don't think that you are getting corn syrup free candies.  Also be aware that there are 2.9 servings per package, so it's going to be 350 calories if you down the entire package (which is easy to do, as the candies are pretty big and there aren't very many per package). If you just want some good candies, go for it, but don't be misled like I was.",

It starts off fairly intense, and holds flavor alright, but I actually like the lost flavor taste as I find it tastes a bit like cola candy, if that makes any sense.

I also reviewed the Crosse and Blackwell Branston Original (much better, IMO) and would recommend it over the Heinz.<br /><br />I noticed that this is packed in Holland.  Don't know if that has anything to do with anything but seems odd.  The crunchy bits are not quite as crunchy as I like, and it's soupy, rather than being thick.  It's not a terrible product, but I believe the Heinz is higher priced than the C&B, so I'd recommend that for more flavor and crunch and less drips.",

If you've never tried it, you dont know what you are missing. This is one of my most favorite foods.

I like the Classic Med. heat packages best because I can make several types of salsa from the same packet. For those who cant stand much heat, I might just add some chopped green pepper & onion. Add some finely chopped cilantro if you want. My favorite is extra chopped green pepper & onion, finely chopped cilantro & either a chopped habenero or jolokia pepper for a great HOT salsa. Just add it all to the blender &  chop  it to the consistency you desire, give it 5-6 minutes for the flavours to blend & you have the freshest salsa you can get.",

            "I was so excited to receive my first dutch-processed cocoa powder especially after all the wonderful reviews of the Frontier one on Amazon.<br /><br />I was first apprehensive about the 'Organic Herbal Essence' - 'Frontier' mixup but when I saw a big red rimmed label with  Frontier  in green on the bag along with USDA Organic & Fair Trade mark/logos among other print, I quickly opened the bag and took out a spoonful of the powder to examine. I was slightly disappointed in the color, as I've read that dutch-processed cocoa powder had a deeper and sometimes redder color. I took out my box of natural, unsweetened Trader Joes cocoa powder and saw that the dutch-processed cocoa was darker and slightly redder in color in comparison, though not as much as I had hoped (and certainly not as deep as the picture on Amazon).<br /><br />I've also read that dutch-processed cocoa has a richer 'chocolatier' fragrance to it and so I took a whiff from the bag. To my dismay, a medicinal, acidic, spicey smell met my unsuspecting nose. I once again grabbed my Trader Joe's unalkalized cocoa powder and it smelled more 'chocolatier' than the Frontier bag. The expiration date is sometime in 2014 so I believe I either got a bad bag or this product is definitely not up to the hype. I even tried to mix some in my cup of coffee, as another reviewer had and raved about, and it tasted so.. 'off' and unappealing I had to mix in some sugar (I dont usually sweeten my coffee) and gulp down the rest (I hate wasting food and the coffee beans were kind of expensive heh).<br /><br />I'm still searching for a good dutch-processed cocoa powder, which is more difficult to find than I had hoped.. Thinking of looking into E Guittard, Pernigotti, or Green & Black next, at the recommendation of others, and Penzeys or Valrhona as last resorts (not available where I live and shipping is a killer). I'd suggest anyone looking for dutch-processed cocoa powder to skip this product and try the next option instead.",

It's a typical English Breakfast style tea flavor wise, somewhat malty, strong and darkish, and makes for a bracing cup of tea.  What I didn't like about it was how astringent it was, almost to the point of being bitter.  So, if you don't like teas that are strongly astringent (puckery dry mouth feeling like a cabernet or zinfandel wine) this is not the tea for you.  The Irish Breakfast and the Assam are much better in my opinion.  More malty, less astringent.",

There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.

            "A longer review than I would usually write for food but since there's 4 different items, I address the set as a whole and each of the different snacks/cookies.<br /><br />Warning for allergy eaters: This is on the back of the box in small print  Contains Milk, Wheat, Soy, processed in a facility that uses eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts .<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to get a variety pack since I had never tried her packaged snacks and small enough that if you don't like them or get allergic to something, you don't have a whole lot to give away and feel you wasted alot of money.<br /><br />*CHEESE STRAWS are the second biggest pro but I would like to buy them on their own in a larger package in the future.<br /><br />* CHEESE STRAWS stay crunchy, taste great, no aftertaste<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Okay, this may seem like a contradiction because I love that I can get a small variety pack in order to try something out - if I got a full box, it would be plenty but once you open the box and then open the little bag stuffed in the bottom, you barely get anything in each package.  No offense but what a waste of a beautiful package/box for less than two servings of a snack.  If you eat a couple here and a couple there (of cheese straws) you could make the package last two days.  If there's two people having two here and two there, and they have complete self control and are very conscious of limiting your portion sizes (people who have the ability to eat 4 potato chips and not go back until tomorrow) I'd give it an hour, or less. For me, the cheese straws lasted an hour - I put them away three times. There's certainly not enough to put in a little nut size bowl and set it out on the coffee table if you are having a couple people over.  This is literally a sample packet put into a box that's made to look like you are getting a full box of treats.<br /><br />One open box is 7  tall and 3 1/2  wide.  Inside the box is a gold bag that is about 5 x4 1/2 .  But the contents of the bag is 4 1/2  wide and only 2  tall.  For the cookies, because they are so sweet/strong you can make them last a few days, and they are tiny (size of a quarter for the pineapple cookies), so just a few will do for the chocolate cookies and pineapple cookies. But still, nowhere near putting them in a nut-size small bowl unless you combine them all.<br /><br /> *All snacks except for the cheese straws, change texture in less than 5 minutes of being open.  Immediately transfer to a tightly closed ziploc or tight lidded  tupperware  type container.  They all are crunchy when opened but after a couple of minutes, the pineapple and the shortbread go from firm , crunchy pecan sandies to falling apart crumbly and can't hold the cookie as a solid piece, the Chocolate marsh go from solid crunchy to a stale chewy texture.  The texture changed before I put them away the very first time and each time I only had a couple cookies and decided to put them away but the texture already changed dramatically.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br /><br />CHEESE STRAWS -<br />If you've had Paula Deen's Macaroni and Cheese - which I was able to find online - and you like it, the Cheese Straws taste very much like the Macaroni and Cheese.  It has a strong Cheddar flavor but not quite  Sharp cheddar  or  mild cheddar , more like a medium with a stronger taste than medium.  It also seems like it is a multi cheese, but I don't know what other cheese is in it. I ate them and tossed the box the night I got them.  They look like crinkle fries, fatter than my pinky,crunchy when opened and they stay that way-while I had them out and each time I went back for more,still crunchy and very good.  No funky after taste (like two others).<br /><br />PINEAPPLE DROP COOKIES - Quarter size, very very strong pineapple taste, with a very very sweet powdered sugar on top that tastes like it has pineapple (or something?) flavoring too.  Bitter after taste, way too strong, crunchy in a  pecan sandies  like texture, unless they are out for a couple minutes, then they crumble.  I had two cookies with a few minutes in between because it was so very strong I didn't know if I really wanted another one.  When I reached in the tiny bag for the second cookie, they were already crumbly.  I couldn't have a 3rd and instead gave them away - they were just terrible, although I usually love pineapple, love sandies type cookies, and love powdered sugar.  But there was nothing good about these.<br /><br />COCONUT PECAN BARS - about 2  long rounded top rectangle, they were mostly broken but that was okay.  These too are like a  pecan sandies  texture to start with, good crunch, but does turn soft and crumbly very quickly. The initial flavor is very good, like a powdered sugar covered pecan sandy with a hint of coconut flavor and obvious pieces of coconut once you chew the cookie, and pecan flavor, but very little in the way of tiny pecan pieces.  The main problem is the awful after taste that lasted way too long-not bitter like the pineapple but just as funky. Worse than that is that the after taste isn't recognizable. It isn't coconut, isn't pecan, it's what I usually call  chemically  because it's not a food flavor. Even strong coffee didn't get rid of it. But I did have four of them before tossing the other 6-8 cookies in the trash.  First 2 were the original texture and the last two fell apart in my hand, like a handful of sand with some coconut.  Literally, not 3 minutes after the first two I ate, the last two were like a totally different cookie, could not hold itself together and the sandies crunch was gone replaced by crumbled ingredients that made the shredded coconut much more obvious (not bad if you like coconut, which I do)but no longer a cookie, more a pile of crumbs. But the after taste is a product killer, I just couldn't have any more.<br /><br />CHOCOLATE MARSH MUD COOKIES-  The best sweet in the assortment.  Round quarter size, sweet enough that you only need a few but not so sweet that you don't want more.  Not mild like milk chocolate, more like bitter-sweet chocolate chips type flavor or cocoa powder.  Except for the bizarre texture change, they were good and I ate them all over a few days.  There's not that many, they are small like the pineapple cookies but chocolatey enough that I couldn't just eat the little bag in one or two sittings.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy them quite as much two hours later when I went to have another two cookies because they had a chewy/stale texture-not chewy out of the oven, but chewy/stale/rubbery and even though they were folded over twice with the sides tucked in, clamped closed with a mini binder clip, and back in the closed box, the texture still morphed - that's just weird to me.  Next day out of a ziploc, still chewy but didn't get worse.  They were still an actual cookie and held together to be eaten like a cookie (well, it's bite-size so it's not like you're going to take a bite anyway, it's too small for that but it's not a pile of crumbs like the other two, but if they were a normal size cookie, they could be bitten into without losing the entire cookie.  Anyway, although it was totally weird, like nothing I've ever seen before, this morphing texture thing that is almost immediate, I still ate the rest of the Chocolate Mud Cookies.  But, I wouldn't buy them again.  They weren't good enough to ignore the texture thing and $5 a box for less than a nut bowl's worth of cookies (they are sold here-- 4 boxes, 3 oz each, same as this set for $19current price-$24 regular price)that's just a ridiculous price for the amount of product, especially considering the quality as a whole.  Sorry Paula Deen, the cookies in this set are just not quality products and 3 oz is much less than you could ever think.  Sadly, the one and only decent product that I would buy again from this sample is the Cheese Straws and it is THE ONLY PRODUCT IN THIS SET THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ITS OWN.  That's a shame because I would buy them today.",

The olive paste is a little salty and strong, but so are the black olives from which it is made.  All of these taste very good and are excellent condiments to use on veggies and eggs as well as pasta.  My only complaint is that there is a little too much olive oil in each jar - I had put them on a slanted shelf in my refrigerator, and a lot of the oil leaked out (even when the tops were tightly screwed on).  Needless to say, I had a mess to clean up but learned that olive oil is excellent for dry skin!  I would definitely buy these again.  This is a good sampler.",

New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.<br /><br />If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.<br /><br />Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA.",

If you like a cookie that tends toward the shortbread style, I think you'll love these.  I've also tried the plain vanilla variety from this company, and it's very, very good as well.",
            "I have always loved the Tree of Life design and this cup reminds me of it. The cup itself is very practical. I use it both with tea bags and loose tea. The little metal filter does double duty in my kitchen as does the lid, fitting another non Tea-Forte cup. I appreciate that the lid keeps my tea warm longer. All in all it's a good value. Without a handle, it fits well in my cabinet. I purchased two others to keep as gifts.",

            "This stuff is EXCELLENT.  It is very pricey, but the taste makes it worth the added expense.  I use this with my Fage or Chiobani Greek yogurt instead of the fruit they add.  That way it is a super healthy and amazingly tasty treat instead of just yogurt or yogurt with a lot of sugary fruit.  I order this all of the time now and will never go back to any other sugar-free jams.  This one tastes better than even the regular full-sugar jams.  Lots of chunky fruit inside, not a colored jelly goo.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these jams.  I am a HUGE fan of xylitol and stumbling across this stuff has made me very happy!",
            "I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.<br /><br />Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney's Lover's Leap.",

Most retail outlets, even specialty shops cater mainly to southwestern and/or Latin American cooking. (we live only a few minutes from the Mexican border) She wanted to make something that had this spice as an ingredient. In the city of San Diego, this spice was hard to find. When we did find it was prohibitively expensive and it was only one ounce.<br /><br />We ended up purchasing that small amount and having that dinner party. However, we looked online and as always Amazon came through. We found cardamon of superior quality and in generous amounts for a price that was more than reasonable.  We got nearly 4 ouunces for less than the price we paid one 1 ounce.",

            "This water is very nutritious because it is pure clean water from an aquifer deep under the NZ mountains. The water's actual age is 50,000 years old.  Water with a low ph increases the acidity in your body overall.  It causes loss of energy, increase in fatigue. But water with a high ph like Eternal Artesian Water from NZ is high in alkalinity.  This is good for cell absorption and overall good health.  I lost my right kidney and adrenal gland in a skiing accident.  Could not get my ph level to the best level for my situation until I started drinking Eternal Water.  Very easy to drink a few bottles everyday.

            "Grand'aroma Marinata Flavored Extra Virgin Olive oil is the best you'll find.  I basted it on salmon for a New Year's Eve dinner and it was excellent, the best tasting salmon I ever ate.  It gives wonderful flavor and works great on all type of fish/seafood.  It is very light and tasty and is not salty or bitter.  It has all the great spices already in it.  I purchased it locally and the shop went out of business (I got in a shower gift kitchen basket) and loved it, but was unable to purchase since then.  I held onto the bottle and just typed in the name after I was unable to get anywhere typing name of company on bottle.  This is really great olive oil and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to cook fish.  I put in on the salmon with nothing else, put under broiler and it was done in a very short time and tasted excellent.  I did add a little S&P to my taste also.  It works great to use in a cruet to make your dressings for salads also.  I give it a 5*.  Thank you.  DP",

I've been buying their bulk pasta for about 4 years and it's always been of great quality with no problems.  I highly recommend it.",

I bought a package at the grocery store thinking I was paying too much, but curious about these cute little guys and knowing that if I liked them I would go to my  go to store  which is Amazon...

And then there is the ludicrous shipping fee for 2 ounces of seaweed... I would love to see this product as an Amazon Prime item...",
            "When I received the box of green tea, I realized I had ordered the wrong tea. I had wanted to purchased the  Stassen  Pure Jasmine Green Tea . So, I sent it back to the company the next day and asked them to please send the Jasmine tea instead. That was more than a month ago, still no tea or response.  Last week I decided to order another box. I don't know if it was from the same company through Amazon but, I got it in less than a week.  I doubt I'll ever see the other box or my $13.00 again, but thank you for the speedy delivery on this one.  I have always had incredibly great service with Amazon...amazing in fact...but, I don't know what happened with the one before.  Let me just say that the Jasmine Green Tea by Stassen is the best ever! About 5 years ago I was in Seattle and visited a restaurant where they served this tea with the meals. It was refreshing and light so I asked the name of it. I have been ordering this same tea ever since and enjoy a cup first thing in the morning with my meditation routine. You can't beat the price and it's so worth it.",

            "When it comes to soft, edible candy it's hard to separate the packaging from the treat itself since we enjoy these sweets with more than our taste buds. I still hesitated to factor the packaging into this review, but ultimately decided that the candy itself wasn't very fresh either. I thought it may have been just a few pieces that were hard/stale, but it's pretty much all of them. I don't know if I received a stroke of bad luck or if the entire supply shipping from Amazon is old. My candy was also severely smashed making the caramel stick to the wrappers. I'm a fairly lazy person so it's a chore to fight with the wrappers to remove them when I want a piece of candy. The cookie part of the Twix were crushed as well and some of the chocolate had that chalky white thing going on.",

I was not disappointed!  I still like oatmeal as my Dad made it with raisins, some pecan chunks and a tablespoon of molasses.  No white sugar is needed...it is pretty sweet! I sometimes add almond milk, but not always!  Golden Barrel Blackstrap Molasses is also great in molasses cookies and Ginger Snaps!  You just have to try it to be consumed by the joy jumping on your tongue!  Thank you Golden Barrel!!",

            "Now of course no dry pasta is going to taste exactly like fresh, but I've got to say, this is as close as I've come. Pay no attention to the title description. This is not spaghetti but a very large (nearly lasagna size) and thick strip of egg noodle. The packages are 10-ounces. The flavor is deep and natural. A-lot of dry pastas these days have very little flavor, this stuff has tons. The texture is also great. These noodles are very  toothsome  they are chewy (in that great homemade sense of the word). One thing to watch out for is the packaging. As soon as you open the box, check the bags of pasta for holes. The stripes of pasta are so thick that their corners can punch through the plastic. I found a couple of bags that had been breached. I used one right away and popped some tape over the other one.",

            "This tea is of good quality, and quite tasty. It is vegetal and sweet, with a medium body. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the leaves were a little bit broken - an issue I seem to have with most varieties of Japanese green tea. I was hoping that leaves processed in this style would fare a little better to shipping than sencha and they did, but not a whole lot<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />After a few more days, my opinion of this tea has only gone up. You absolutely need to steep this tea at least twice. The first time for 1-2 minutes, and the second for 30-45 seconds. The first steeping seems to extract a lot of the bitter and tannic components which hide the real flavor. The second steeping although short, its much more flavorful than the first",

This is the only type of salt I am using since I discovered it. I put it on meat, fish, veggies, salads, soups,etc. Everything tastes better with this salt. I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt.",

I went in on S&S deal to make the deal more palatable (yes), and I don't regret the decision. If you are a fan of granola, you will live this. It has a hint of sweetness but not overpowering like others I have had. In addition, as one reveiwer said, the caloric content is a bit less than other silmilar granola cereals I have had.

            "This one (sweet sour) and the Kung Pao are very good. Both are better than many Chinese resturants. In the case of the Sweet and Sour the chicken you put in is considerably than the heavily crusted stuff you get at many resturants. I personally stir in a small can of pineapple chunks plus the one that comes in the box and a cut up green pepper and some cut up onion shortly before removing the wok from the stove. Too early overcooks and too soon results in cold spots. I dump the seasoning powder in a large zip lock bag and then toss the chicken in the seasoning. It makes for very tasty chicken. I also go beyond what the box calls for with the Kung Pao. I add some celery, onion and 1  squares of green pepper. I also add a table spoon of red chili sauce to the mix for added spice. It is adequately spicey for most out of the box. I found the spicy garlic to be quite good. I was unimpressed with Cashew chicken.",
            "First of all, I do buy this at my local supermarket because it is a little cheaper (even with tax). I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!",

There is a very nasty, artificial acrid, too citrusy, while at the same time too sweet, taste to these products. The strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry, but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable.  I poured the mix out.  The Mai Tai mix -- poured it out.  I bought several bottle/dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first.  BIG MISTAKE!  I am either going to pour them out or throw them out, since the folks at Baja Bob's web site have refused to even respond to my request that I return the unopened products for a refund.

Usually I do share it with a family member, but if not, the leftovers make a tasty lunch.  The flavor of the sauce is very authentic.  Not too heavy or light-just right.  The amount of rice noodles is substantial.  The package makes a good size meal for two.  I add my own chicken pieces or shrimp along with some green onions, and if I have some broccoli, I'll throw that in as well.

The reason they are perfect for my two dogs ( a Lab and a Chow mix) is not the size obviously but because I have a dog toy that is one of those toys that you pull out the center and fill the different layers inside with treats. After putting the center piece back in you shake it around and the dog has to learn to push it with his nose or paws to get the treats to lay just right to fall out. Well my Lab learned in one day and just loves this toy. The ONLY treats that I have found that fit are this brand and he loves all the flavors but especially the cheese flavor and the yogurt brand. There are quite a lot in one bag and reasonably priced. Yes, I will buy more!<br />Buddy Bits Rocks!",

            "First of all, the maca powder comes in a package that looks very different than the one pictured - I was looking forward to learning more product information by reading about maca, but the bag is a metallic pouch with a nondescript sticker label on the front, and a similar label on the back (both of which just say that it is red maca powder and don't give further details).<br />When opening the package, the smell is overwhelming (it is a loamy smell which is very pungent and unfortunately, the maca powder tastes just like it smells).  The powder is extremely chalky in texture (although this isn't necessarily to be unexpected with supplement powders), and has a taste that is truly unique (I can't quite convey what it tastes like, but even when mixed in with various foods, the potent flavor lingers and the food begins to taste like maca rather than concealing the flavor).  While I believe that the health benefits of the product are impressive, with a taste that makes it hard to consume enough to reap these benefits, it may be easier to get pills (or work really hard to find a recipe that conceals the maca flavor). The one things that seems to help diminish the flavor is putting it in the refrigerator (this is also the best way to preserve the maca as this is a large package of it and it would be a shame to see it spoil).",
            "I have tasted several brands of barley tea.  All of the following were cold brewed, including the one I bought here.  One of them was a gift from Japan and wasn't roasted, so it wasn't bitter at all.  One of them was roasted and VERY bitter.  Another one was a mixture of lightly and deeply roasted and tasted okay (not very bitter).  This one I am reviewing however, is excellent in taste.  It isn't bitter at all, even after cold brewing for several days.  The package says it is gently roasted in small quantities.  That, plus the fact that it is organic, I believe is the reason it doesn't have the bitter taste.  If you don't like bitter drinks and want to drink barely tea, this is a great choice.",

The reason I bought this 5 pounder was when I did some simple calculation noticed it was getting pricey in smaller quantities, so I thought, as it is a dried item why don't I buy in bulk and store it away from heat and moisture (to avoid any kind of fungus/mold formation) and enjoy the savings - paid essentially only half the price compared to buying in small bottles/packages.

This makes sense, as it's rum flavored, but I expected something a bit sweeter given that it's infused into the grind instead of poured into my cup straight from the bottle.  Adding cream/milk and an occasional shot of flavored syrup helps mellow the taste and makes it more enjoyable, but I'm still not sure if I will drink all 4 packs.

Not only is it jam packed with great vitamins and minerals, but it also has the highest antioxident value of any discovered fruit. The taste is very similar to the Acai berry, but in powder form, the maqui is quite bitter. I recommend mixing it with some other fruit. The way I use this powder is in a morning smoothie---it gives me a full day's worth of fruits and 1 serving of veggies all jam packed into my breakfast...I love this because it's always so hard to fit in fruits and veggies otherwise.<br /><br />My smoothie:<br />2 tsp maqui powder<br />1 tbsp chia seeds (also a super food)<br />1 tbsp wheatgrass powder (another superfood)<br />1/2 cup fresh or frozen fruit (I normally use strawberries, blueberries, or mango)<br />6 or 7 ice cubes<br />1/2 to 3/4 cup water<br /><br />Makes me feel full all morning long.

            "I like  Vernor's , and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime.  The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is  The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now  ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.",

It's an all over body moisturizer, fantastic hair conditioning treatment, great to cook with, and it has incredible health benefits if you eat it raw. Put some on your toast, in your smoothie, to pop stove popcorn, etc. It's a great makeup remover too. I have THE most sensitive skin of anyone I've ever met- I can't use most sunscreens, soaps, perfumes, etc. and this stuff is great. Put it on cuts and bruises- it makes an antibacterial seal over the cut and fades dark splotches. You can put this stuff on your newborn. THIS is the definition of 100% natural. Plus, this particular brand is organic and you have a cute jar when you're done. Seriously, magic in a jar.",

            "If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.",

I've consumed several of the Roland teas from Hong Kong and this one seems to have at least a little flavor of the applicable fruit or spice.  I sense the sweet aroma every time I open the can.  I'm not a fan of overly sweet flavorings and usually do not select any fruity teas, but this one is perfect for my taste with a subtle almost lychee aroma, requiring no sweetening additions.  The tannins are not overwhelming and it stands up well in the cup.  It makes a lovely iced tea (my favorite now), so summer screams out for this variety.  At the low cost of around a dollar (or less at the time of this writing), I'm going to pick up more for friends enjoyment.

My only problem with grilled veggies is that there are seldom leftovers for the next day when I do this really simple, stupid recipe:<br /><br />Try those mini-sweet peppers, mushrooms, asparagus, onions, garlic, artichoke hearts, thinly sliced sweet potatoes, etc.  Slice/clean them to chunky stir-fry size.  Marinate them in olive oil and this amazing fig-balsamic vinegar glaze.  Grill them on a wok-for-the-grill -- saves skewering them (no matter how well you do it, they still fall off!).  Remove when done to your liking.  Then drizzle more of this glaze and then add salt and pepper to taste.  You will get raving reviews from your guests.  The problem is that once you put it on the plate (and I have a HUGE one), everything disappears before you, the grill-master, gets a chance to nibble some!  So keep aside what you want, THEN give the rest to your guests!<br /><br />I've done many meats grilled with this as a finishing glaze -- even moose and bear.

I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic  coffee . The  crema  is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino.",

Eventually we went through every type of canned and dry food at the supermarket. Then I started feeding her actual human food. She liked ground beef, steak, and chicken well enough, but she wasn't thrilled by it. I got a sample of Natural Planet Organics dry food and she gobbled it up as fast as she could.<br /><br />Now that I'm feeding it to her, it doesn't look like she's getting tired of it -- like she did with other food -- and she's looking better and healthier than she's done for a year. If I give her a choice between Natural Planet and raw or cooked chicken breast or beef, she chooses Natural Planet instead.",

            "I have been giving this oil to my 13-year old arthritic Siberian Husky for about 2 months now. He has been getting some type of fish oil for about a year. This oil has made the biggest and most noticeable difference in his mobility. With cheaper oils he improves but still needs occasional anti-inflammatories to keep him from limping and getting too stiff. With this oil he doesn't need the meds, and he has been moving easier and faster on our walks. He doesn't limp even after a 2-hour hike on hilly terrain.<br /><br />He also gets monthly Adequan shots - and it really seems to be the combination of the fish oil and the Adequan that keeps him moving at this level. But I definitely have noticed a difference with the different brands of fish oils I have tried. This and Nordic Naturals (the stuff for humans, not the kind for pets) have been the best by far. I highly recommend this product.",

The only problem is that it can get a bit too soft, so you can't roll it too thin or it'll tear when you're lifting it up to put it on the cake. I've had to re-roll it on more than one occasion because of this. It tastes worlds better than Wilton fondant, that's for sure.",

Everything was great, and if you live in the US, I encourage trying it if you like energy drinks, it's definitely a different taste in comparison to the ones we have here.

This summer, my brother and his wife brought back a variety pack from their trip to Hawaii. There's chocolate-covered ones, plain, and sea salt. Out of the 4 or 5 different cans, this is my favorite by far.<br /><br />The dusting of seasoning is delicate and makes an already tasty snack even better. When I got to the bottom of the can, I ran my finger around the inside walls to get out all the extra bits of garlic and onion powder, showing how despondent I was at having eating them all. That's how good these are!<br /><br />Nuts are naturally high in fat, so try to control yourself if you're on a restricted diet! It's nearly impossible to stop eating these.

Well, I found these Lindt bars on Amazon from the seller above and was delighted to receive REAL Swiss chocolate, un-melted, well packaged and in just a few days!

Plus for the price of four small grocery store bottles of cumin I got 2 lbs. I have found that if you put spices like this right into canning jars and store them in a cool place and keep them completely out of any light they will last for years. It's just not true that they lose their flavor in six months or a year. Not if you store them right. Minimize their exposure to air and light and they will last for a very long time.",

I try really hard to limit the amount of sugar in my diet, but also avoid artificial sweeteners at all costs (I'd rather just have the sugar). As soon as this arrived, I cracked open a can, poured it over ice into a glass & took a whiff. It smelled great--like a regular cola! It looked right--perfect color, lots of carbonation, etc. But that's as far as it went with the positives... as soon as I tasted it, I shuddered--literally. It tastes like an extra sweet version of Diet Pepsi (my most HATED soda, ever). The sweetness is sickening, tastes NOTHING like a sugar-type of sweetness, and leaves a really metallic taste in my mouth. I tried several times to choke it down, thinking that maybe I'd get used to it after a few sips--but no, I ended up dumping the rest down the drain. I wish I had tried just ONE can instead of ordering a 24 pack! I'm so bummed out--guess it was just too good to be true.",

No blender required, though blending does make it frothy.<br /><br />It's a great emergency-preparedness item to have on hand.<br /><br />Tastes good, and even better if for some reason you haven't eaten and are famished.  If you have any insulin resistance going on, you will crash because of the high sugar content.  This is not great nutrition as with some of the protein powders, but with milk it suffices nicely.<br /><br />This is not a breakfast  food  per se, in my opinion.  It's a snack to tide you over, not a substitute for a meal.  Sending a kid off to school after only a serving of this would be unconscionable.<br /><br />It's more akin to a chocolate shake.  Makes a nice treat, or dessert beverage.<br /><br />It is what it is, and it excels at that.  No need to make it more than it is.",

            "Ronzoni Garden Delight Radiatore may be a more expensive pasta than others, but I think it's worth it.  Having a full serving of vegetables per 4 ounces of pasta makes it a healthier option than plain pasta.  Plus, the veggies add a bit of flavor to the pasta that changes things up a bit, in a good way.<br /><br />I like the radiatore shape for macarroni and cheese.  It makes a good base, with lots of crevaces to fill with cheese.  It feels heartier, too.<br /><br />You can taste the veggie powders used in this pasta.  To me, there is a flavor of mild tomato soup and mild vegetable broth, as though you've cooked the pasta in a concentrated vegetable broth.  I tastes pretty good, and actually makes the mac and cheese taste great!  Even my hubby liked it!<br /><br />Along with the vegetables, you also get fiber and protein with the pasta.  There's a good amount of Vitamin A, which usually isn't in pasta.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend at least trying Ronzoni Garden Delight in place of regular pasta in most any dish.  It adds a different flavor, but it isn't overpowering and blends into your meal.  Whether it's a hot or cold dish, using this radiatore in it makes it healthier and tasty.<br /><br />OVERVIEW:<br /><br />PROS:<br />- good flavor, can taste mild vegetable flavors<br />- cooks up well and easily<br />- provides extra nutrition regular pasta doesn't<br /><br />CONS:<br />- more expensive than regular pasta",

            "The milk chocolate chunks in this product are heavenly.  The reason for the 3-star rating, whereas my other reviews of the Al Wadi halvas are higher, is primarily because of the inconsistency in the quality of the product from tub to tub in the same case, in the same shipment.  The first one I opened was amazing.  There were enormous globs of those wonderful chocolate chunks and the halva was soft, and resembled chocolate chip cookie dough in texture with this sweet, nutty taste that was to-die-for.  The next tub I opened was quite dry and although it had some good chunks in it, I found that I was basically digging out the chocolate and avoiding the halva, which was hard, dry and nearly tasteless.  The remaining tubs followed this trend.  I compared the halva in this product (just the halva) to the plain Al Wadi halva and it didn't taste nearly as good; it was also harder and drier and more compacted.  If I were rating on the halva alone in this particular iteration, I would have to give it 1 or 2 stars, but the stellar chocolate pieces really deserve some credit, so I settled on an overall rating of 3 stars.  I don't think that this type has as much benefit for breastfeeding mothers as the plain or pistachio types because of the large amount of chocolate which has been introduced to the product, and the benefit comes in the halawa extract which is in the halva and not the chocolate.  If you're looking to increase your breast milk production, get the plain or pistachio; however, I think the American palette would be more receptive to this, the halva with chocolate, IMHO.

            "JACOBS CRONAT GOLD INSTANT COFFEE makes an excellent cup of coffee!<br />ESPECIALLY if one likes a MILD cup of coffee.  Although the package<br />directions suggest NOT to boil the water, but to pour it just below<br />boiling, I have tried it both ways -- and find that, like other<br />instants, JACOBS CRONAT GOLD INSTANT COFFEE suits my own tastes bet-<br />ter, if the water is boiled a LONGER time...the longer, the better!<br /><br />Tastes do differ -- and I find I, myself, like a deeper, more robust<br />brew.  However, if the water for this instant coffee is boiled LONG<br />enough, I find that a wonderful hint of strength is brought forth<br />amongst the mild taste, giving it a unique and delightful flavour,<br />which I have found, so far, in NO other instant coffee!<br /><br />  COFFEE....INSTANT....COFFEE<br /><br />The jar this coffee comes in is pleasing indeed!  Made of VERY heavy<br />glass,, I found that, (ordering four at a time to save on postage),<br />that the unopened package could easily be used as a doorstop!  The<br /> crown -like cover is easy to open -- in a seemingly-circular, (but<br />actually fifteen-sided figure), design. Those 15 sides make it VERY<br />easy to open!<br /><br />On the two sides of the golden label, are printed directions for<br />use -- in NINE languages!  I can read the English, (UK) directions,<br />and recognize, (I think), the lettering for the Russian, (MK) -- or<br />is it Greek -- directions, though I cannot read them.  The other<br />directions -- for  AL ;  HR/BiH ;  SRB..(Serbia?) / MNE ; and  SI ,<br />are in languages I do not know.  It's fascinating to look at this<br />label, however -- because it confirms my suspicions that Americans<br />are woefully under-educated, as I, (who was educated in District 26<br />in Queens, New York -- reputedly one of the best public school<br />districts in New York City, and in Queens College of the City of<br />New York, (which also has a sterling reputation), could recognize<br />but two of these languages!  I also noted -- with some alarm -- that<br />FRENCH does NOT seem to be one of the nine languages used for these<br />directions!  Maybe it IS there, and I have had too many years pass<br />between college French classes and now....but if it ISN'T there, the<br />manufacturers of this coffee are MISSING a market which will NOT<br />accept ANY merchandise of ANY kind, without FRENCH instructions<br />being given on the packaging: QUEBEC, CANADA!  (This includes EVERY<br />imaginable  product: in the infamous  Matzo-gate  of several years<br />back, the government of Quebec would not even allow Matzo to be<br />imported into Quebec, for Jews celebrating Passover, because there<br />was NO FRENCH LETTERING on the boxes!)  This is all the more aston-<br />ishing to me, as it seems that the JACOBS Coffee Company has now<br />become a subsidiary of the KRAFT FOODS CORPORATION (!) -- a very<br />large food company, which should be aware of the Quebec law!  (Or<br />perhaps they are just too busy producing yummy food to have re-<br />membered this?)  Anyway, I happen to have relatives in Quebec --<br />so I KNOW this Quebec law -- of having FRENCH language directions<br />included on EVERYTHING, is true.  So, if KRAFT, and JACOBS, want<br />to sell this coffee to the Quebec, Canada market, I respectfully<br />request they include FRENCH directions on the packaging!<br /><br />Altogether, this is a delicious instant coffee -- especially if<br />you like MILD instant coffee.  The thick glass and 15-sided top,<br />bespeak quality, and the labeling, in 9 languages, is like a<br />mini-miniscule armchair trip to Europe, for curious Americans!",

They even like the Blue tuna too, though they have not liked much else. But actually I can put some of this salmon on top of other Blue food (like the seafood stew) and then they seem to like that well enough.

            "I am ordering this tea from Amazon for the third time. I previously ordered in 2009 and, again, in 2010. In both of those cases, the product came in a package of different design that contained 25 bags per box. I paid $21 in 2009 and $25 in 2010 (for six packages, in each case); thus, the price has not changed significantly in the past few years.<br /><br />Two days ago I found a lonely box of this tea hidden in the back of my cupboard, and, while it bears an  enjoy by  date of May 2011, it is still tasty as of this writing in February of 2012.<br /><br />I agree with the other two reviewers: this is a nice tea (and one can also enjoy it as an iced tea). It has a wonderful flavor, and seems to have a soothing effect on my aching knees... so much so, that, after feeling the positive effects of this tea for the first time, and believing that that  healing  effect might be a result of the eleuthero, the second-listed ingredient, I actually bought eleuthero capsules to use as a daily supplement. As they did not seem to be as effective in easing the pain in my knees, I am reordering the tea and skipping the supplements.<br /><br />According to Good Earth's own blurb from my previous purchases, this tea contains no caffeine... how they manage that with green tea, I am not sure. I am also not sure why they feel the need to add natural flavors (containing soy lecithin) as the third ingredient.<br /><br />Besides the benefit of what I believe to be this tea's  healing properties , it is just a wonderful tea to enjoy with friends after dinner.<br /><br />The old container was made from 100% recycled materials. I'll give an update on the new container.",
            "I really enjoyed Riesen and i found this candy thoroughly pleasurable.  This treat is dark chocolate on the outside and has a chewy caramel center on the inside.  Its taste an texture were a real delight.<br /><br />riesen is different.  Unlike other candies that are overwhelming sweet and sugary, riesen is full of flavor.  Th exterior dark chocolate has a smooth feel, and a rich chocolate taste.  For me, its the flavor of the exterior that does it for me.  Unlike other dark chocolates which can be bitter this chocolate is only 45% cacao which gives you a great mix between sweet and dark.  I just wish there was more dark chocolate.<br /><br />the interior of a riesen is chewy and has a deep rich creamy sticky caramel flavor.  again this caramel does not have that strong sugary taste instead you taste the richness of creamy caramel but in a hard format that becomes softer and chewier over time until it melts in your mouth.  This delicious long lasting caramel was excellent.<br /><br />My only problem with this product is the lack of nutrition but im not expecting to eat kale or Goji berries,  i come to this product for pleasure, taste and texture.  My hats of to stock manufacturer of this wonderful candy,  i will continue to buy it in the future",

Used it on some chicken thighs on the smoker (though I didn't cook 'em slow--just under an hour at 375F). This sauce must have opium in it, it's so good. The honey caramelizes up quite nicely, and wonder of wonders: it's not overly salty! I actually added a smidgeon of salt after the first time I cooked with it! Now what I do is let my chicken pieces sit in it for 1-3 hours, having added just a touch of my favorite carne asada seasoning ('cuz it's REAL salty), then baste it at 20 minutes, and again at 40 minutes. Comes out quite sweet, and the garlic is not at all overstated. Do yourself a favor & give this a try; I don't think you'll be disappointed. Also nice is the soft-pack style container, which allows you to squeeze out any air when you're putting the unused portion into the refrigerator (I typically use about half a pouch for seven to eight large chicken thighs, but this could probably be stretched just a bit) Good Stuff, Maynard!",

            "Most cat owners know the benefits of grass for their feline's digestive health.  Animals that are strictly indoor residents don't have easy access to grass, so it's up to their owners to supplement this need for their pets.  Most pet stores carry some type of 'ready to use' oat grass, however a combination of overwatering and artificial light in stores causes heavy mold growth at the base of the grass and on the root system, limiting life of the product and producing health concerns for both pet and owner.<br /><br />To avoid such issues, I've been in search of a good cat grass to grow at home.  After going through several other exceptionally poor products, I gave the Petlinks system a try.  The system comes enclosed within a round white plastic tub and contains everything you need to grow grass (container, soil, oat seed) except water.  The instructions are simple and clear, and allow individuals with 'brown-thumbs' to produce a lush, thick green product.<br /><br />The first step is to poke some small holes in the bottom of the container.  The product instructions indicate 4-6, however since I used a very small object (turkey skewer) to make the holes I ended up making ~15 holes across all areas of the container the bottom to allow for sufficient drainage. In the second step, you plant the seeds; the product instructions indicate you  stir in the seeds, ensuring most are covered .  If that is followed as stated, it could cause variability in the extent of your yield; while you may get sufficient growth, it probably wouldn't be optimal as it would be difficult to get sufficient soil coverage of the seeds.  A better idea is to remove about 1/4  to 1/2  of soil from the container (using a tablespoon) before sprinkling the seeds on the surface of the remaining soil in the container; lightly cover the seeds with the soil you removed to complete the planting process. By doing this, it ensures all the seeds are sufficiently covered and will grow to their maximum capacity.  The final steps are to place the container on a small saucer, water the soil with 1/4 cup water, loosely place the lid on the tub, and place the entire thing in a warm dark place (I used a kitchen cupboard).  Expect to see sprouts emerge in ~3 days (it will be quite evident as they push the lid up with their growth); once that happens just remove the lid, move the entire unit to a sunny location and keep the soil slightly moist.  You'll get full growth in ~7-10 days, though it will vary as some of the seed germinate faster than others.  This is actually a benefit as it makes the system more robust and provides a thick growth of the product due to the staggered sprouting.  Best of all, cats love it!  I've had to break up a couple fights between my two cats already over the first harvest.  :)  I've posted some photos of a 10-day growth (with a ruler included for scale) so you can judge the end result for yourself.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - Easy to use<br />  - Goof-proof instructions<br />  - Thick, healthy product that grows fast<br />  - Cats love it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - None",

The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.

It's like the period on the end of the day for him. He doesn't feel ready to go to bed until he gets his  Good Night Biscuit.  He gets restless and whiney until I remember that it's his bedtime.

            "*****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes:  Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair.  I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",

It is certified organic, and is kosher. It has the most amazing tart and lovely taste. If you like lime, you'll love this tea. If you don't like lime, definitely pass, as it is a very intense  lime experience . I love it!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer lyrically writes:  From the far reaches of the Arabian Desert, this rare lime has been enjoyed for thousands of years, both as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine and as a teasan. Traditionally harvested and dried in the hot desert sun, this oasis of Vitamin C has been drunk to soothe just about everything. The first taste brings a distant yet familiar impression, leaving the trace of a fleeting memory on the tip of your tongue. We find that its clean, bracing, and reviving citrus pleasure, nicely balanced with a touch of sugar, lifts the blues. Try it, you'll fall in love with it! <br /><br />If you like Numi teas and enjoy lime, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love lime, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.

Actually I want to complain to UTZ, which I have never done with any food company for dissatisfaction but it didn't cost me too much and they know it.<br /><br />Snyder's lost 1 star because it has high sodium. If you're not washing down gallons of water with this you might get kidney stones.  All crunchy snack foods are like that but this one is worth it.  Also Honey mustard & Onion is the only flavor to get, I don' know why they bother to put out other flavors because they're not very good.  Yes, it is subjective.<br /><br />To the reviewer that gave it 1 star for being too hard, man, brush your teeth more so you have perfect teeth and gums like I do.  Get more foods with texture, hardness, and different consistency.

            "I've been making jam for years using low-sugar Sure-Jell (you can get away with using even less sugar than listed on the package if you're generous with the lemon juice).  My jam always comes out beautifully.  Unfortunately, I ran out of Sure-Jell tonight, and used a packet of Pomona's Universal Pectin that was sitting in my cupboard instead.  BIG mistake.  The jam jelled, all right, but the final consistency was pasty and the brightness of the fruit flavors was totally clouded.  I got pretty much the same results as if I'd thickened my fruit with corn starch.  Ick!  Next time I'll stick with Sure-Jell.",

            "I LOVE Polenta and started using this brand when the grocery store near me carried it.  Everyone, EVERYONE commented on how delicious it cooked up!  Then, for some reason, the grocery store discontinued it....so I went looking on line and found this person and HIGHLY reccommend them and their product.<br /><br />The Polenta came promptly, was wrapped carefully.....I am very satisfied and happy to have found a good new source for this wonderful, nutritious polenta.<br /><br />Do give  Bob's Red Mill Grits Corn Polenta  a try if you like Polenta and have never tried thier brand....I think you will be very pleased as I am.",
            "We're big fans of Coffee Bean Direct whole beans and have tried about 6 varieties. This one is  okay , being relatively weak, little body and rather thin in flavor. Not bad, but simply not as impressive as the other ones. Our favorite had been the Mocha Java (style), having purchased multiple 5-lb bags and consistently finding it terrific. We are now trying a new one: Indian Monsooned Malabar, and it is absolutely spectacular.",
            "I didn't look at the case of dog food when it arrived too carefully.  When I started to feed it to my dog I found that half of the cans were dented.  Not a big deal, at least not until I got to the cans that were dented so badly that they had lost the seal.  It was all moldy at the top and I had to throw those ones out.  My dog does love this, but then he loves all canned food I have given him.  I bought this because it is one of very few canned dog foods that are meant for puppies, and it was one of the most affordable ones too.  I was disappointed that the food comes all ground up in a paste.  Some of the adult Purina canned foods have actual pieces of meat and rice that you can see (there is usually a picture of what it looks like on the back).  I have also read up on some of the ingredients here and I am going to switch to another brand with better ingredients and with ingredients that I can actually see, even if it means feeding my dog an adult formula.  Purina isn't bad, but if you can afford to spend a little more there are much better brands out there.",

            "Taste strongly  of vanilla cinnamon and cherries.  Quite sweet like a dessert wine even though the bottle says semi sweet. Taste great with cheddar cheese and grilled food like kabobs and burgers. I guess the guy at the store said it taste even better if you put slices of orange in it. You can also make really killer cocktails with it by mixing orange juice and rum. ( I didn't try it. Cuz I am not a cocktail person) Very light and perfect for summer and fall. Reminds me of a Catawba or a White Zinfandel.Great for a bathtub companion or a get together. Will leave you and the people you share it with smiles all around. It is under ten dollars , but doesn't taste it.<br />Please serve extremely chilled for several hours. It is undrinkable at room temp.",

We have always had a hard time finding a local retailer, but a couple of years ago found that we could order it via Amazon's  subscribe and save , and having been doing so for some time - but it seems Amazon has just recently discontinued it (at least in the 50 ounce size).<br /><br />Really great tasting water - hope that Amazon continues carrying it.",

            "Honestly, if you want an excellent pecan pie,find a decent recipe, make your own dough, put fresh ingredients in it, and make it yourself.  Otherwise, the dough is going to taste stale and the filling, mediocre.

And they do not sell online or by mail.",
            "The Balance Bar Gold Lemon Meringue Crunch bar is a good energy bar. At 28 percent sugar, 14 grams for a 50 gram bar, it is in the lower range of sugar content for energy bars. It is not too sweet.<br /><br />The bar has a nice lemon flavor. To me, it tastes a lot like lemon meringue pie. I suggest that key lime would also make a nice flavor for this kind of bar. As the product description says,  No pie we've ever tried came with the satisfying crunch and nutritional punch delivered by this energy bar.  That may be somewhat of an exaggeration, but the bar does taste good and does have a balanced set of natural ingredients.<br /><br />One observation is that each bar weighs in at 200 calories. This makes it good for vigorous exercise, but perhaps too much to take a whole bar for a snack. On the other hand, we have been having snow storms every few days this year. I think that shoveling qualifies as vigorous exercise, so I can eat as many of these bars as I want to without worrying about calories.",

I was able compare them side by side and this #12 is not close to the same good flavor. I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally #12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually  grape must  and a condiment quality. But including the #12 designation does mislead. So I gave it one star based on the easily confused product. It was not what I was expecting so I am unhappy with the result. Others may enjoy the flavor but the real thing is much better.",

            "I love Devil Dogs. Unfortunately, here in the Seattle area they are not for sale. For the last few years I have odered them online. The product you are viewing is sold by an affiliate merchant with Amazon. Shipping is done by the seller. I wouldn't be surprised if the seller buys the Devil Dogs at a local supermarket, boxes them, and ships. In terms of the product itself, well Devil Dogs are really wonderful. This review is more about buying them than extolling their value as a treat.<br /><br />The first thing to know is that Drakes Cakes short dates Devil Dogs. They have an expiration date less than a month after manufacture. This is their way of assuring freshness. Expect the product you receive from this vendor to have a week or less of time before the  sell before  date. This is not a problem. As long as you get them before the sell-by date, you will be fine. One really nice thing about this product is that you can safely freeze them in their package. I just open the carton, unpack, the retail packs and put them in the freezer. I then pull them out one box at a time as needed. They don't get stale that way and the taste does not change due to freezing.<br /><br />As far as this seller goes, shipping is pompt. In this case they came in a Priority Mail package. No damage of any kind. My one complaint is the shipping cost. As I recall it is nearly $8 per order of 6. Now that isn't too bad all things considered. What did bother me is that when I priced a double order (12 retail packs), the shipping price doubled! There is no savings if you order more. What this means to me is that I will only order 6 boxes at a time. So, if you figure the cost: $26 for the product and $8 for shipping, you are paying $34, which turns out to be about 71 cents each. Well worth it to me.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great treat, fairly priced, and promptly shipped. A good deal all around.",
            "The salt liocorice was very good.  It came nice and moist, so even our three year old could chew it up.

I know I could have ordered double zout, but this for single salt should have been slightly saltier.<br /><br />Enjoy!",

As I'm not reviewing this based on the price, I'm giving it a full 5 stars.",
            "Gjetost is a Norwegian delicacy.<br /><br />My fiance's beloved Aunt (at over 80 years of age) still gets up every morning at 4:00 in northern Norway to (single-handedly) tend her goats and cows.  Gjetost is made from a blend of cow's milk and super-nutritious goat milk.<br /><br />It has a slighly sweet disposition which comes from carmelizing the sugars in the blended milks.<br /><br />This cheese is an excellent morning starter. It has a concentration of natural sugars in it (most Norwegian dairy products are organic even if they are not labeled so).<br /><br />My fiance has to go to her Norwegian church in New York to get this delicacy as you usually cannot find it anywhere in the U.S..

Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.",
            "Extremely tasty candy with a texture unlike anything on the candy shelves in America. Imagine, if you will, popping a piece of soft strawberry gum into your mouth and beginning to chew--the first few seconds are always the best, when you get a blast of intense strawberry flavor along with a firm, enjoyable chew, right? Then imagine that gum melting away gradually on your tongue, without losing any of its flavor, rather than enduring and just becoming stringy and bland. Very nice indeed.",

They smelled so good that my husband tasted one, thinking they were people jerky treats -- and told me it was great jerky.  One of my dogs is allergic to grain and chicken, so these are perfect for him.<br /><br />There are no preservatives, the smoke flavor is from actual smoking and not liquid smoke flavor -- and they're made in the USA.

He used 4 pouches to feed our family of 7 and there was enough left over for he and I to bring to work for lunch the next day.<br />With a special promotion the cost was just over $1 per pouch which is a resonable price.

            "First off these  gummi  apples don't have the gummi consistancy that haribo's other gummi candies have. They were so soft that they were like eating gum drops instead of a gummi product. I know what you are thinking, they were probably just really really fresh. No that wasn't it. I have purchased (and enjoyed) the haribo gummi sour cherries and they were very fresh when I received them but they still had the gummi texture that I was looking for. I had someone else try the candy just to see if they agreed with me and they said the same thing I do, that these aren't anything like gummies. I don't know... maybe I got a bag from some weird mutant batch and maybe they aren't always like this. Who knows.<br /><br />The second thing is that the flavor is a bizarre apple-ish flavor that was not enjoyable in the least. It had kind of a chemical taste to it.<br /><br />I absolutely do NOT recommend this product. Try the sour cherry, it is much, much better.",

            "This is for HappyBaby Happy Tot fruit pouches. These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it.[...] Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website.  [...]) Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm197570.htm). In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected.",

            "My husband and I traveled the US for several years and always enjoyed buying the local honey. After moving to Oklahoma to stay I wanted to give him a suprise. The packaging of this honey is why I bought it (and I wasn't disappointed! My husband didn't want to tear the paper to open it and was relunctant to let me throw it away :))But the flavor is why we will buy it again and again!! This is the smoothest honey I have ever tasted! In fact, my son is soon turning one and we want to avoid the sugar overload of cake and frosting- instead he will get this honey!",

            "Acid is, oddly, the most benign of flavor amplifiers.  Think about it.  Sugar? Salt? Alcohol? Fat?  I do not mean in any way to be a food fear monger. I merely point out that first glance, acid seems more menacing than any of those.  For kitchen magic, acid rules mine.  A splash of lime, coffee in my red-eye gravy, all those wonderful vinegars are lining my shelf.<br /><br />Now the resurgence of an ancient and feisty acid, verjuice.  It has largely been neglected outside of wine country.  Most of mine comes from odd places in Bordeaux.  But you can get this fine find from Fallot, a most reliable maker from Burgundy.  You may know their fine mustards.  This is one verjuice which you may confidently measure others against.  Why?<br /><br />Verjuice had not had modern marketing to spread its unique quality and flavor.  Sour grapes, you say? Exactly.  What do you do when the weather is so crumby that the grapes are not sweet enough for wine?  A good excuse to press verjuice.<br /><br />Now for the bad news.  Verjuice is in resurgence.  As with all things rediscovered, many are busy  helping  its image with a facelift.  Culinary botox.  From California to Australia, everybody is getting into the act; thin or flabby faux verjuice is hitting the shelves.  All cute and flouncy, it has not the backbone and courage to do the heavy lifting in the kitchen.  You might as well pour lemonade over your grilled salmon.<br /><br />But here is the acidic glory.  Taste it alone.  Now you can compare anything you might run across.  Some vineyards make the veritable verjuice.  Next, try poaching gently some fresh and really ripe fruit.  It loves to be swirled into your beurre blanc.  Whip some into your best cream.  Deglaze the roasting pan for some old time gravy.  Nutmeg and a nice five pepper blend (don't forget the allspice) are all you need for your steamed vegetables.   What did you do?   And you can tell the truth.",

            "I was trying to tell my 91 year old auntie about  bubble tea.   She just didn't get it.  Then one day we were out in Palm Desert and saw an advertisement for it inside a shopping mall.  We walked the length of the mall to the food court, and wouldn't you know ?? THE BUBBLE TEA STAND WAS CLOSED !! that day.  So, I couldn't even let her experience it after we had walked so far to get it!!  I mailed the milk tea kit to my sister. (Aunt Ruth is Scot-English, she puts milk in tea) so that my sister could make the bubble tea for her.  So she can't experience the heat sealed plastic cup top, at least she can swallow the big bubbles !!  Bubble Tea just isn't readily available around 29 Palms, CA.  Thank you for letting bubble tea be part of her  bucket list.   !!",

            "I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.",

This last batch was very crunchy; not sure if it was the way they were baked or if they were older.  Either way, the dogs liked them.  I took a few to work to give co workers for their dogs and and they thought the shape was cute and their dogs liked them also.  Even my husband, the football fan would give these to the dogs and usually he has nothing to do with  my dogs.   With that said, they must be good!",
            "This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two. Not only is it inferior to The Spice Lab, but Faerie's Finest is the worst smoked salt I have tasted.",

            "I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have.",

            "...but the grand total of 3.5 tiny pakora contained within the sauce were dense, sort of tough. If you find something else to add to the sauce, you might have a decent dish - the sauce is tasty, though a bit thinner than I would expect.<br /><br />There are at least three problems I see. The pakora (traditionally, a fried dumpling of gram (say, chickpea)) flour are too few... except for the 2nd problem, that they aren't very good. So - less is better? Anyway, over 2/3 of the pouch was sauce. But, I don't think anyone will feel slighted by less of *these* pakora. And, thicken the yogurt sauce... water is relatively cheap in such small quantities - even when you ship it across the planet. Bottom line, the product is hugely water.<br /><br />All-in-all, I don't think this product was well thought out and it underperforms.",

The great citrus and crisp, non-sugary taste is an ideal way to start the morning off before a work out. Also, I feel almost guilt free because solixir isn't trying to fool me into thinking that a 20 minute spike in energy followed by a 30 minute coma is the way a healthy energy drink should feel. If you're looking for a great way to feel energized without the jolt/ crash feeling from other energy drinks, very few of which are even natural products, then go with solixir.",

Yes some out there might say that the price may be a little high, but if you factor in the cost of gas to go to the store and back then it hurts a little less in the price. It arrived quickly in the mail and was well packaged. The crackers came wonderfully intact in the bags. I liked the way they were packaged;they come in a resealable bags that makes it a good snack that you can save for future ''urges'' for a salty treat. I wish that the company has a low salt variation of this flavor. I also love the Chedder Cheese flavor too. I would recommend this to a friend to give it a taste.",
            "I have always loved stollens whether homemade by my aunts in Milwaukee or the imported German stollens. I must say these cranberry stollens are really tasty without being sicky sweet. They are chocked full of all the ingredients of traditional German stollens but the addition of cranberries really makes for a full flavored treat. Sometimes you will get a sour flavor from the addition of cranberries to breads but not in this fine German product. The flavor is excellent and the cranberries add an additional fruity flavor to this fine holiday bread. The bread is moist and not dried out like many other stollens. Very good and different for those who want to try a new twist to the traditional stollens.",

            "These Ritz Toasted Chips are awesome. I love the freshness of them. They are satisfyingly crunchy and have a great flavor. Decidedly more healthy than potato chips since they have significantly less fat. They're also made from soybean oil so you get some of the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />They hold up well in dip, unlike most potato chips that usually end up breaking in the dip. Also when dipping into something like salsa, these have no problem scooping up the salsa without becoming soggy.<br /><br />They are obviously a snack food so calories are something to keep an eye on... these are 130 calories per 13 chips (approx) and the 8.1oz bag contains 8 servings. Sodium is 250mg per serving, probably fairly typical or maybe a little lower than some other similar snack products. I could do with a little less salt personally. But I don't think it's excessive for this type of product. Hey, if you want totally healthy, you should be eating carrots, not toasted chips :-)<br /><br />There are one of my new favorites for snacks and I rate them a solid 5 stars.",

For those of you who like a little touch of sweet and mostly just the natural earthy taste of almonds I recommend this.<br /><br />It is very thick so a little would go a long way for those of you who would spread this on toast or something, which is a bonus at the price per jar. (though without mentioning names I have seen more expensive brands of almond butter in smaller jars and not as tasty so I personally cannot complain about the price)<br />I personally eat one tablespoon for extra energy in the afternoon before the gym but I would imagine this nut butter is fantastic anyway and probably straight out of the jar with your finger!

            "This pasta is hot enough that with an appropriate sauce, such as a Thai peanut sauce, it's hard to stop eating.  I add fried sweet potatoes and garden serranos.  Sort of like a moderately hot salsa, there's an instinct to just keep eating it.  It isn't so hot that it is unpleasant to eat and it doesn't have any chili flavor of its own.<br /><br />You can eat it with a marinara and I do, seasoning it with red pepper flakes.  I'm not a heat freak by any stretch and neither are my dinner guests, but the kick is a welcome alternative and the foundation for many great dishes.  This also goes well with an alfredo or other cream sauce.  I wouldn't recommend it for something Mediterranean styled full of delicate flavors such as capers and olive oil.  Whether it goes well with pesto or is sort of a waste of pesto is debatable.  It's a great base to Indian dishes with goat cheese and lots of fresh vegetables like squashes, zucchini, cauliflower, and so on.<br /><br />Rossi Pasta's website has this same size at the same price.  (I keep trying to order on it, but it makes you recover the password for the account you didn't want to create each time and then still can't process the order.  It might be one of those  it only works with IE  deals that works for most people, but just barely.)<br /><br />As long as I'm griping, I'd like to see a bit better price on this bulk size.  $5/pound is pretty steep for pasta.  The gourmet, hand-made stuff in the unaffiliated corner organic grocery has some delicious locally made pasta in small quantity for the same price per pound.

            "*****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called  teasans ):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes:  From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest. <br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",

The product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous.  The package was small and light weight but I was charged $6.78 for shipping of a $4.99 item.  I have bought many items from amazon.com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand. I bought several items and the shipping was all together.  Therefore I did not know how much was charged for each item. I will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping.  Enough said.",

            "My dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues.  The staining was a big problem and I did quite a bit of research to find a solution. I considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently  work however many of them are actually antibiotics I am not sure it is a good idea to use very often.  My research  led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries.<br /><br />Yes, the first ingredient is potato however in FirstMate's defense, most companies include several non-protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else.  Also, meat  meal  is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat (somewhere in the range of 300% more concentrated).",
            "I love having these around for a quick snack. They are extremely low on calories and have a high fiber content. Having a high fiber content usually leads to feeling full quicker- so that you don't go overboard. The ranch flavor is the best among all of them.",

I would definitely get this again and am going to gift it to a friend who is gluten free and also watching her weight.  I think she will love this.  I took one start off for the price.  This stuff is so expensive!!!!",
            "The flavor of this chocolate is quite good.  Good amount of sugar for a milk chocolate bar.  The caramel has an OK flavor, and I understand that this is a 'salted caramel' bar, but the salt is just a little bit overpowering.  The bar is peppered with hard salty caramel chunks, which are good, but I was expecting soft vs. crunchy caramel.  Overall, the bars are a nice treat and I likely will order these again.",

He wouldn't eat much but when he did he either couldn't keep it down or it ran through him - very unpleasant for all of us.

It is fresh smelling and tasting, and it has a lot of flavor in the cup. Most mates are more in the background of the black tea in my concoction. This mate is front and center. I really enjoy it.<br /><br />On top of all that, it is not expensive. In fact, for its quality it is quite a bargain. I hope I can continue to get this product at this price.<br /><br />I have a gourd and I have used it once or twice.<br /><br />My preferred method is to use three cups of water to two teaspoons of tea and two of mate. I cool the water for 60 to 70 seconds before pouring it over the mixed tea and mate. I'm not a purist, but I get something I like and can drink on a consistent basis. It makes a good amount of liquor and it is mild to the palate and gives a good dose of caffeine.<br /><br />For tea, I use PG Tips Loose Tea.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/B001EQ5JJQ >PG Tips Black Tea, Loose Tea, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>",

It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles aren't thick enough for me, but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that, I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor.",

I bought the Skippy because it was a good price and it's a bit easier because you don't need to stir it when you first open it. The oil in Teddie Natural separates and floats on top, but once mixed and refrigerated it stays mixed pretty well. I also like the Skippy because it doesn't require refrigeration, so I can keep it in my desk at work for a quick snack.",

            "Addendum to my review...  I left my original review unedited below.  I edited my star rating at behest of my wife.  She really liked Dr. Flynn's granola, but did not think it was the  best ever.   However, considering she is a granola lover too, I cannot discount her powerful opinion.  We sat down and had a taste test with various granolas.  I concede that Dr. Flynn's can hold its own in any comparison, but it certainly does not distance itself either; it is within the peloton.  I also concede that my original scathing review was the result of inflated expectations based on the existing glowing reviews.  We are unsure if we would purchase this again.  Our overall favorite remains Nature's Path.<br /><br />Ok.  My wife got me addicted to Natures Path Hemp granola and their pumpkin seed granola about seven years ago.  Those cereals are so good I crave them, and I never liked granola before.  We had been buying the Natures Path granola at local grocers and kept getting stuck in the eye, so I was happy to see that I could get orders of six at a time through Amazon for a good price.  I was recently re-ordering the granola when I noticed that Dr. Flynn's Organic granola was actually rated higher, by reviewers, than the Natures Path that I love so dearly.  How could that be possible, I thought, so I ordered three bags of the stuff to try it out.<br />Wow, was I surprised!  There are things on this good Earth that are inherent truths that cannot be seen otherwise.  Baby hugs and kisses are wonderful things.  Murder is bad.  Natures Path granola is absolutely delicious.  These statements cannot be effectively argued against.  Dr. Flynn's granola, however, is no where near being a universal good.  I would rate it no better than what a reasonable home chef could prepare on the fly.  It is essentially just rolled oats, nuts, raisins, coconut, sugar, and some cinnamon.<br />I sincerely believe that there is no way that all of those glowing reviews are real, as I do not believe that such a high percentage of people could have mistaken Dr. Flynns granola for a 5 star product.  It tastes like granola.  Below average granola.<br />If you must find out for yourself, I strongly recommend you try one bag instead of my three.  I got burned.",

Vital Choice only recently corrected their website and apparently neglected to update Amazon.",
            "Tea arrived quickly - very nice selection and colorful boxes - was disappointed that the plastic container that the tea came in was cracked in several places - was packaged well for shipping so that wasn't the problem - I just think the plastic case they use is very flimsy and can't withstand any kind of shipment.  I just put the tea boxes in a basket to give as a gift.  Would still recommend because I was told the tea is very tasty.",
            "As a child, every year my German godmother would give me an advent calendar filled with wonderful chocolates. Now that I have godchildren of my own, I have continued the tradition. Until recently, I have always been disappointed with cheesy, uninteresting artwork and sub-par chocolates from Cadbury's and the like. I was skeptical when buying this from Amazon because it was so much cheaper than other calendars on this site, but boy was i wrong - this could be the same calendar I got as a kid! This is a real German calendar with real German chocolate and an old-timey hand-drawn Christmas scene (it's just printed of course, I don't mean someone drew each box!). I ordered 6 and got 2 different designs. Great stuff altogether - I'll definitely be ordering more next year.",
            "This oatmeal is great. It is a lot more flavorful than typical oatmeal. I heard about it on Oprah and gave it a try from our local store, but paid a lot for it. I saw I could get it from Amazon in bigger bulk but much less per can in the end, so I stocked up. I save the leftover cans as decoration for my kitchen. They look like something you'd get from an old five and dime store and I love that."
