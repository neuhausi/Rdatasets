Only working women are included in these data. \nBeginning in 1997, German health reform in part entailed a 200\nco-payment as well as limits in provider reimbursement. Patients were surveyed for the \none year panel (1996) prior to and the one year panel (1998) after reform to assess \nwhether the number of physician visits by patients declined - which was the goal of \nreform legislation. \nThe response, or variable to be explained by the model, is numvisit, which \nindicates the number of patient visits to a physician's office during a three month period.",
