As originally \nreported by Flaherty et al (2012), researchers recorded information about \nsquirrel behavior and forest attributes across various plots in \nScotland's Abernathy Forest. The study focused on the following variables.\nresponse      cones\t number of cones stripped by red squirrels per plot\npredictor  \tsntrees  standardized number of trees per plot\nsheight standardized mean tree height per plot\nscover   standardized percentage of canopy cover per plot\nThe stripped cone count was only taken when the mean diameter of trees was under 0.6m (dbh).",
