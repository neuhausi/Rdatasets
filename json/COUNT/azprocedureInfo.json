A subset of the \nfields was selected to model the differential length of stay for patients entering \nthe hospital to receive one of two standard cardiovascular procedures: CABG and PTCA. \nCABG is the standard acronym for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft, where the flow of \nblood in a diseased or blocked coronary artery or vein has been grafted to bypass \nthe diseased sections. PTCA, or Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty, is \na method of placing a balloon in a blocked coronary artery to open it to blood flow. \nIt is a much less severe method of treatment for those having coronary blockage, with \na corresponding reduction in risk.",
