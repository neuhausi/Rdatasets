(2008) who were interested in \nhow certain deep-sea fish populations were impacted when commercial fishing \nbegan in locations with deeper water than in previous years. Given that there \nare 147 sites that were researched, the model is of (1) the total number of fish \ncounted per site (totabund); ( 2)  on the mean water depth per site (meandepth); \n(3) adjusted by the area of the site (sweptarea); (4) the log of which is the \nmodel offset."
