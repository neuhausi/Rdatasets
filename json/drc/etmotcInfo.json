The experiment constitutes a typical\ndose-response situation. The dose is concentration of the antibiotic erythromycin (mg/l), which is an antibiotic\nthat can be used by persons or animals showing allergy to penicillin, and the measured response is the relative\ngrowth rate in biomass of mixed sewage microorganisms (per hour), measured as turbidity two hours after exposure\nby means of a spectrophotometer. The experiment was designed in such a way that eight replicates were assigned\nto the control (dose 0), but no replicates were assigned to the 7 non-zero doses. Further details are found in\nChristensen et al (2006).",
