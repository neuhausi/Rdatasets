The seeds were incubated for \n24 hours in a 0.3% solution of potassium nitrate in order to imbibe seeds prior to the test. A total of 200 seeds were placed on filter plate. \nAfter initialization of the tests, the number of germinated seeds was recorded and removed at 34 consecutive inspection times. \nDefinition of a germinated seed was the breakthrough of the seed testa by the radicle. \n</p>\n<p>Chickweed is known to have dormant seeds and therefore we would not expect 100% germination. It means that the upper limit \nof the proportion germinated has to be incorporated as a parameter into a model, which adequately reflects the experimental design \nas well as any expectations about the resulting outcome.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>Data are kindly provided by Lisa Borggaard (formerly at the Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Copenhagen).\n</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Ritz, C., Pipper, C.
