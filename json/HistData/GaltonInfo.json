   "description" : "Description\nGalton (1886) presented these data in a table, showing a cross-tabulation of\n928 adult children born to 205 fathers and mothers, by their height and\ntheir mid-parent's height.\nHe visually smoothed the bivariate frequency distribution and showed that the\ncontours formed concentric and similar ellipses, thus setting the stage for\ncorrelation, regression and the bivariate normal distribution.",

   "reference" : "The data are recorded in class intervals of width 1.0 in. He used non-integer\nvalues for the center of each class interval because of the strong bias toward\nintegral inches.",
