   "usage" : "data(\"Pollen\")",
   "reference" : "The first three variables are the\nlengths of geometric features observed sampled pollen grains - in the\nx, y, and z dimensions: a \"ridge\" along x, a \"nub\" in the y\ndirection, and a \"crack\" in along the z dimension.  The fourth\nvariable is pollen grain weight, and the fifth is density.",
