   "description" : "Description\nThe data frame Michelson gives Albert Michelson's measurements of the velocity of light in air, \nmade from June 5 to July 2, 1879, reported in Michelson (1882). \nThe given values + 299,000 are Michelson's measurements in km/sec. \nThe number of cases is 100 and the \"true\" value on this scale is 734.5.\nStigler (1977) used these data to illustrate properties of robust estimators\nwith real, historical data.  For this purpose, he divided the 100 measurements\ninto 5 sets of 20 each.  These are contained in  MichelsonSets.",
