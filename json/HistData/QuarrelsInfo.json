A quarrel consists of one             \npair of belligerents, and is identified by its\nbeginning date and magnitude (log 10 of the number of deaths).\nNeither actor in a quarrel is identified by name.\nBecause Richardson took a dyad of belligerents as his unit,\na given war, such as World War I or World War II comprises\nmultiple observations, for all pairs of belligerents. \nFor example, there are forty-four pairs of belligerents coded for              \nWorld War I.\nFor each quarrel, the nominal variables\ninclude the type of quarrel, as well as political, cultural, and economic\nsimilarities and dissimilarities between the pair of combatants.",
