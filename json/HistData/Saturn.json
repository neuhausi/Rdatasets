When the actual positions of Jupiter and Saturn were\ncompared with the tabulated observations of many centuries, it appeared that\nthe mean motion of Jupiter was accelerating, whereas that of Saturn was\nretarding. Halley was able to improve the accuracy of the tables by an\nempirical adjustment, and he speculated that the irregularity was\nsomehow due to the mutual attraction of the planets. But he was unable to\nprovide a mathematical theory that would account for this inequality.\n</p>\n<p>If the observed trends were to continue indefinitely, Jupiter would crash into\nthe sun as Saturn receded into space! The problem posed by the Academy could be\n(and was) interpreted as requiring the development of an extension of existing\ntheories of attraction to incorporate the mutual attraction of three bodies, in\norder to see whether such a theory could account for at least the major observed\ninequalities as, it was hoped, periodic in nature. Thus stability would be\nrestored to the solar system, and Newtonian gravitational theory would have\novercome another obstacle.\n</p>\n<p>The problem was an extraordinarily difficult one for the time, and\nEuler's attempts to grope for a solution are most revealing. Euler's work\nwas, in comparison with Mayer's a year later, a statistical failure. After he\nhad found values for <em>n</em> and <em>u</em>, Euler had the data needed to\nproduce seventy-five equations, all linear in <em>x, y, m, z, a</em>, and\n<em>k</em>. He might have added them together in six groups and solved for the\nunknowns, but he attempted no such overall combination of the equations.\n</p>\n<p>Laplace had come quite a bit closer to providing a general method than\n<code>Mayer</code> had. Indeed, it was Laplace's generalization that enjoyed\npopularity throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, as a method that\nprovided some of the accuracy expected from least squares, with much less\nlabor. Because the multipliers were all -1, 0, or 1, no multiplication, only\naddition, was required.&quot;\n</p>\n<h3>Author(s)</h3>\n<p>Luiz Fernando Palin Droubi</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>Stigler, Stephen (1975). &quot;Napoleonic statistics: The work of Laplace&quot;,\n<em>Biometrika</em>, 62, 503-517.\n</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Stigler, Stephen M.
