(1955).  \nThere were actually two clinical trials, corresponding to two statistical designs (<code>Experiment</code>),\ndiscussed by Brownlee (1955).  The comparison of designs and results represented a\nmilestone in the development of randomized clinical trials. \n</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<pre><code class='language-R'>data(PolioTrials)</code></pre>\n<h3>Format</h3>\n<p>A data frame with 8 observations on the following 6 variables.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>Experiment</code></dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>ObservedControl</code> <code>RandomizedControl</code></p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>Group</code></dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>Controls</code> <code>Grade2NotInoculated</code> <code>IncompleteVaccinations</code> <code>NotInoculated</code> <code>Placebo</code> <code>Vaccinated</code></p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>Population</code></dt><dd><p>the size of the population in each group in each experiment</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>Paralytic</code></dt><dd><p>the number of cases of paralytic polio observed in that group</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>NonParalytic</code></dt><dd><p>the number of cases of paralytic polio observed in that group</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>FalseReports</code></dt><dd><p>the number of cases initially reported as polio, but later determined\nnot to be polio in that group</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p>The data frame is in the form of a single table, but actually comprises the results of two separate\nfield trials, given by <code>Experiment</code>.  Each should be analyzed separately, because the designs\ndiffer markedly.\n</p>\n<p>The original design (<code>Experiment == \"ObservedControl\"</code>)\ncalled for vaccination of second-graders at selected schools in selected areas  \nof the country (with the consent of the children's parents, of course). \nThe <code>Vaccinated</code> second-graders  formed the treatment group. \nThe first and third-graders at the schools were not given the vaccination, and formed the \n<code>Controls</code> group. \n</p>\n<p>In the second design  (<code>Experiment == \"RandomizedControl\"</code>)\nchildren were selected (again in various schools in various areas), \nall of whose parents consented to vaccination. \nThe sample was randomly divided into treatment (<code>Group == \"Vaccinated\"</code>),\ngiven the real polio vaccination, \nand control groups (<code>Group == \"Placebo\"</code>), \na placebo dose that looked just like the real vaccine.   \nThe experiment was also double blind:  neither the parents of a child in the study nor the doctors treating the child knew which group the child belonged to.  \n</p>\n<p>In both experiments, <code>NotInnoculated</code> refers to children who did not participate in the experiment.\n<code>IncompleteVaccinations</code> refers to children who received one or two, but not all three\nadministrations of the vaccine.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>Kyle Siegrist, &quot;Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics&quot;, <a href=\"http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/Polio.html\">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/Polio.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>Thomas Francis, Robert Korn, et al.
