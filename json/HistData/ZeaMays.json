There are 15! permutations, but a reasonably\nlarge number of random permutations would suffice.  But this doesn't take the paired samples\ninto account.\n</p>\n<p>(b) Permutation test based on assigning each <code>abs(diff)</code> a + or - sign, and calculating the mean(diff).\nThere are <code class=\"reqn\">2^{15}</code> such possible values.  This is essentially what Fisher \nproposed.  The p-value for the test is the proportion of absolute mean differences\nunder such randomization which exceed the observed mean difference.\n</p>\n<p>(c) Wilcoxon signed rank test: tests the hypothesis that the median signed rank of the <code>diff</code> is zero,\nor that the distribution of <code>diff</code> is symmetric about 0, vs. a location shifted alternative.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>Darwin, C.
