Each shows the frequency distribution squares containing\na <code>count</code> of 0, 1, 2, ... yeast cells. These are combined here in <code>Yeast</code>. \nIn addition, he gives a table\n(Table I) showing the actual number of yeast cells counted in the 20 x 20\ngrid for sample D, given here as <code>YeastD.mat</code>.\n</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<pre><code class='language-R'>\tdata(Yeast)\n\tdata(YeastD.mat)\n\t</code></pre>\n<h3>Format</h3>\n<p><code>Yeast</code>: A frequency data frame with 36 observations on the following 3 variables,\ngiving the frequencies of \n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>sample</code></dt><dd><p>Sample identifier, a factor with levels <code>A</code> <code>B</code> <code>C</code> <code>D</code></p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>count</code></dt><dd><p>The number of yeast cells counted in a square</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>freq</code></dt><dd><p>The number of squares with the given <code>count</code></p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><code>YeastD.mat</code>: A 20 x 20 matrix containing the count of yeast cells in each square for\nsample D.  \n</p>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p>Student considers the distribution of a total of <code class=\"reqn\">Nm</code> particles distributed over\n<code class=\"reqn\">N</code> unit areas with an average of <code class=\"reqn\">m</code> particles per unit area.\nWith uniform mixing, for a given particle, the probability of it falling on any one\narea is <code class=\"reqn\">p = 1/N</code>, and not falling on that area is <code class=\"reqn\">q = 1 - 1/N</code>.\nHe derives the probability distribution of 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\nparticles on a single unit area from the binomial expansion of <code class=\"reqn\">(p + q)^{mN}</code>.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>D.
