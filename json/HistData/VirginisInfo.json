Herschel published two papers in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society\ndetailing his investigations of calculating the orbits of twin stars from observations of\ntheir relative position angle and angular distance.\nIn the process, he invented the scatterplot, and the use of visual smoothing to obtain a reliable\ncurve that surpassed the accuracy of individual observations (Friendly & Denis, 2005).\nHis data on the recordings of the twin stars \\gamma Virginis provide an\naccessible example of his methods.",
