The method of contagion of cholera\nwas  not previously\nunderstood. Snow's map is the most famous and classical example in the field  of\nmedical cartography, even if  it didn't happen exactly  this way.\n(the apocryphal part is that the epidemic ended when the pump handle was removed.)\nAt any  rate,\nthe map, together with  various statistical annotations,  is  compelling because\nit points to the Broad Street pump as the source of the outbreak.\n</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<pre><code class='language-R'>\tdata(Snow.deaths)\n\tdata(Snow.pumps)\n\tdata(Snow.streets)\n\tdata(Snow.polygons)\n\tdata(Snow.dates)\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Format</h3>\n<p><code>Snow.deaths</code>: A  data frame  with 578  observations on  the following  3\nvariables, giving the  address of a  person who died  from cholera. When  many\npoints are associated with  a single street address,  they are &quot;stacked&quot; in  a\nline away from the street so that they are more easily visualized. This is how\nthey are displayed on  John Snow's original map.  The dates of the  deaths are\nnot individually recorded in this data set.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>case</code></dt><dd><p>Sequential case number, in some arbitrary, randomized order</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>x</code></dt><dd><p>x coordinate</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>y</code></dt><dd><p>y coordinate</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><code>Snow.pumps</code>: A data frame with 13 observations on the following 4 variables,\ngiving the locations of water pumps within the boundaries of the map.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>pump</code></dt><dd><p>pump number</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>label</code></dt><dd><p>pump label:  <code>Briddle St</code> <code>Broad St</code> ... <code>Warwick</code></p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>x</code></dt><dd><p>x coordinate</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>y</code></dt><dd><p>y coordinate</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><code>Snow.streets</code>: A data frame with 1241 observations on the following 4 variables,\ngiving coordinates used to draw the 528 street segment lines within the boundaries of the map.\nThe map is created by drawing lines connecting the <code>n</code> points in each street segment.\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>street</code></dt><dd><p>street segment number: <code>1:528</code></p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>n</code></dt><dd><p>number of points in this street line segment</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>x</code></dt><dd><p>x coordinate</p>\n</dd>\n<dt><code>y</code></dt><dd><p>y coordinate</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><code>Snow.polygons</code>: A list of 13 data frames, giving the vertices of\nThiessen  (Voronoi) polygons  containing each  pump. Their\nboundaries define the area that is closest to each pump relative to all  other\npumps. They are mathematically defined  by the perpendicular bisectors of  the\nlines between all pumps.

There are a total of 616 deaths represented in both\ncolumns <code>attacks</code> and <code>deaths</code>; of these, the date of the attack is unknown \nfor 45 cases.\n</p>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p>The scale of the source map is approx. 1:2000.  The <code>(x, y)</code> coordinate units are 100 meters,\nwith an arbitrary origin. \n</p>\n<p>Of the data in the <code>Snow.dates</code> table, Snow says,\n&ldquo;The deaths in the above table are compiled from the sources mentioned above in describing the map; but some deaths which were omitted from the map on account of the number of the house not being known, are included in the table.&rdquo; \n</p>\n<p>One limitation of these data sets is the lack of exact street addresses. Another\nis the lack of any data that would serve as a population denominator to\nallow for  a comparison  of mortality  rates in  the Broad  Street pump  area as\nopposed to  others.  \nSee Koch (2000), Koch (2004),  Koch\n&amp; Denike (2009) and Tufte (1999), p. 27-37,  for further discussion. \n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>Tobler, W.
