   "description" : "Description\nDarwin (1876) studied the growth of pairs of zea may (aka corn)\nseedlings, one produced by cross-fertilization and the other\nproduced by self-fertilization, but otherwise grown under identical \nconditions.\nHis goal was to demonstrate the greater vigour of the cross-fertilized plants.\nThe data recorded are the final height (inches, to the nearest 1/8th)  of the plants in each pair.\nIn the Design of Experiments, Fisher (1935) used these data to illustrate\na paired t-test (well, a one-sample test on the mean difference, cross - self).\nLater in the book (section 21), he used this data to illustrate an early example of a non-parametric permutation\ntest, treating each paired difference as having (randomly) either a positive or negative sign.",
