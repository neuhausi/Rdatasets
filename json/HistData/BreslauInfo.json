David Bellhouse (2011) resurrected the original\nsources of these data, collected by Caspar Neumann in the city of Breslau (now called Wroclaw),\nand then reconstructed in the 1880s by Jonas Graetzer, the medical officer\nin Breslau at that time.\nThe dataset here follows Graetzer, and gives the number of deaths\nat ages 1:100 recorded in each of the years 1687:1691. Halley's analysis was based on the total\nover those years.",
