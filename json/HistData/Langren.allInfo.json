   "description" : "Description\nMichael Florent van Langren (1598-1675) was a Dutch mathematician and astronomer, who served\nas a royal mathematician to King Phillip IV of Spain, and who worked on one of the most significant\nproblems of his time&mdash; the accurate determination of longitude, particularly for navigation at sea.\nIn order to convince the Spanish court of the seriousness of the problem (often resulting in\ngreat losses through ship wrecks), he prepared a 1-dimensional line graph, showing all the \navailable estimates of the distance in longitude between Toledo and Rome, which showed\nlarge errors, for even this modest distance.  This 1D line graph, from Langren (1644), is believed\nto be the first known graph of statistical data (Friendly etal., 2010).\nIt provides a compelling example of the notions of statistical variability and bias.\nThe data frame Langren1644 gives the estimates and other information derived from the\npreviously known 1644 graph.  \nIt turns out that van Langren produced other versions of this graph, as early as 1628.\nThe data frame Langren.all gives the estimates derived\nfrom all known versions of this graph.",
