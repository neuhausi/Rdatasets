   "description" : "Description\nIn the second issue of Biometrika, W. R. Macdonell (1902) published an extensive\npaper, On Criminal Anthropometry and the Identification of Criminals\nin which he included numerous tables of physical characteristics 3000 non-habitual \nmale criminals serving their sentences in England and Wales.  His Table III (p. 216)\nrecorded a bivariate frequency distribution of height by finger length.\nHis main purpose was to show that Scotland Yard \ncould have indexed their material more efficiently, and find a given profile more quickly.\nW. S. Gosset (aka \"Student\") used these data in two classic papers in 1908,\nin which he derived various\ncharacteristics of the sampling distributions of the mean, standard deviation and\nPearson's r. He said, \"Before I had succeeded in solving my problem analytically, I\nhad endeavoured to do so empirically.\"  Among his experiments, he randomly shuffled\nthe 3000 observations from Macdonell's table, and then grouped them into samples\nof size 4, 8, ..., calculating the sample means, standard deviations and correlations\nfor each sample.",
