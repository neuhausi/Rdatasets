   "reference" : "Scientists Scott and Chen published research that compared the effects of caffeine with those of theobromine (a similar chemical found in chocolate) and with those of a placebo. Their experiment used four human subjects and took place over several days. Each day each subject swallowed a tablet containing one of caffeine, theobromine, or the placebo. Two hours later they were timed while tapping a finger in a specified manner (that they had practiced earlier, to control for learning effects). The response is the number\nof taps in a fixed time interval.",
