   "usage" : "A data frame with 30 observations on the following 5 variables.",
   "reference" : "In 2001 engineers at an R&D lab Agri-Tech, Inc, in Woodstock, Virginia, designed a 3-D system that they hoped would improve on the existing 2-D system for measuring the size of oysters. The 3-D system used computer scanning to estimate an oyster volume, whereas the old 2-D system estimated a cross-sectional area. Data shows the result of both systems, as well as the actual weight and volume of each oyster used in calibration.",
