The angle of the funnel and the angle of the tube with respect to the flat table could be adjusted by changing the height of either (Funnel measured from the table, Tube measured from the top of the funnel).   The ball rolls down the tube, then swirls around the funnel until dropping out at the bottom.  Total trip time was measured with a stopwatch.  Heights were adjusted after every two drops in a randomized order.",
