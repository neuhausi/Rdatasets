   "reference" : "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an enzyme deficiency that keeps a person from being able to synthesize enough dopamine. The amino acid phenylalanine inhibits the enzyme needed to synthesize dopamine, and so to some extent, a diet low in phenylalanine can moderate the symptoms of PKU. In short, less phenylalanine in the diet should lead to more dopamine in the brain. The dopamine level for each patient was measured after a normal diet and after a week on a low phenylalanine diet.",
