   "reference" : "Eighteen, lightly embalmed, cadaveric knee specimens were used in a study to compare three different methods of meniscus repair.  The specimens were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments: vertical suture, meniscus arrow, FasT-Fix.  They were evaluated on three different response variables: load at failure, stiffness, and displacement.",
   "usage" : "A data frame with 18 observations on the following 4 variables.",
   "parameters" : {
      "FailureLoad" : "Load at failure (in Newtons)",
      "Displacement" : "Displacement (in mm)",
      "Method" : "Meniscus repair method (1 = Vertical Suture, 2 = Meniscus Arrow, 3 = FasT-Fix)",
      "Stiffness" : "Stiffness (Newtons/mm)"
