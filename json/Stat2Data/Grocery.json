An experiment was designed to test whether the amount of discount given on\nproducts affected the amount of sales of that product. There were three levels of discount, 5%,\n10%, and 15%, and sales were held for a week. The total number of products sold during the week\nof the sale was recorded. The researchers also recorded the wholesale price of the item put on sale.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>These data are not real, though they are simulated to approximate an actual study.
