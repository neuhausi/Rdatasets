   "usage" : "A data frame with 72 observations on the following 4 variables.",
   "reference" : "Subjects in a reaction time study were asked to press a button as fast as possible after being exposed to either an auditory stimulus (a burst of white noise) or a visual stimulus (a circle flashing on a computer screen).  Average reaction times (ms) were recorded for between 10 and 20 trials for each type of stimulus for each subject. Data also identifies which subjects are musicians."
