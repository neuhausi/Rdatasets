Random sampling methods\nare used to obtain a sample of registered voters in Franklin County every two weeks, and these\nindividuals are sent a summons to appear for jury duty. One of the most difficult aspects of Tom's\njob is to get those registered voters who receive a summons to actually appear at the courthouse for\njury duty. This dataset contains the 1998 and 2000 data for the percentages of individuals who reported\nfor jury duty after receiving a summons. The reporting dates\nvary slightly from year to year, so they are coded sequentially from 1, the first group to report in\nJanuary, to 26, the last group to report in December. A variety of methods were used after 1998\nto try to increase participation rates.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>Franklin County Municipal Court\n</p>\n</main>\n</div>\n",
