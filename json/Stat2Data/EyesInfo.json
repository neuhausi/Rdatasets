   "reference" : "DilateDiff is, essentially, the difference in pupil dilation when looking at (a) same-sex nudes and (b) opposite-sex nude photographs. More specifically, multiple measurements of pupil size were taken under each of the two conditions, together with a third condition that involved a neutral stimulus. Within-subject z-scores were then computed, which led to the DilateDiff numbers used here.",
