Milgram's subjects were asked\nto monitor the\nanswers of a &quot;learner&quot; and to push a button to deliver shocks whenever the learner gave a wrong\nanswer. The more wrong answers, the more powerful the shock.\nEven Milgram himself was surprised by the results: Every one of his subjects ended up delivering\nwhat they thought was a dangerous 300-volt shock to a slow &quot;learner&quot; as punishment for repeated\nwrong answers. <br />\n</p>\n<p>Even though the &quot;shocks&quot; were not real and the &quot;learner&quot; was in on the secret,\nthe results triggered a hot debate about ethics and experiments with human subjects.\nTo study attitudes on this issue, Harvard graduate student Maryann de Mateo conducted a\nrandomized comparative experiment. Her subjects were 37 high school teachers who did not know\nabout the Milgram study. Using chance, Maryann assigned each teacher to one of three treatment\ngroups:<br />\n</p>\n<p>Group 1: Actual results. Each subject in this group read a description of Milgram's study,\nincluding the actual results that every subject delivered the highest possible &quot;shock.&quot; <br />\n</p>\n<p>Group 2: Many complied. Each subject read the same description given to the subjects in\nGroup 1, except that the actual results were replaced by fake results, that many but not all\nsubjects complied. <br />\n</p>\n<p>Group 3. Most refused. For subjects in this group, the fake results said that most subjects\nrefused to comply. <br />\n</p>\n<p>After reading the description, each subject was asked to rate the study according to how ethical\nthey thought it was, from 1 (not at all ethical) to 9 (completely ethical.)\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>&quot;An experimental study of attitudes toward deception&quot; by Mary Ann DiMatteo.
