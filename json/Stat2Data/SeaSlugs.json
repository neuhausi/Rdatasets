The larvae from these sea slugs need to locate this type of seaweed to survive. A study\nwas done to try to determine whether chemicals that leach out of the seaweed attract the larvae.\nSeawater was collected over a patch of this kind of seaweed at 5-minute intervals as the tide was\ncoming in and, presumably, mixing with the chemicals. The idea was that as more seawater came\nin, the concentration of the chemicals was reduced. Each sample of water was divided into 6 parts.\nFifteen larvae were then introduced to this seawater to see what percentage metamorphosed (an indication that the\ndesired chemical was detected).\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>Data downloaded from http://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/seaslug-explanation.html\n</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>A paper based on these data: Krug, P.J. and R.K.
