Some participants in\nthe study were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was offered financial incentives for\nachieving weight loss goals, while others were assigned to a control group that did not use financial\nincentives. All participants were monitored over a four month period and the net weight change\n(Before - After in pounds) at the end of this period was recorded for each individual. Then the\nindividuals were left alone for three months with a followup weight check at the seven-month mark\nto see whether weight losses persisted after the original four months of treatment. This dataset has only\nthe non-missing 7-month data.  The 4-month data are in WeightLossIncentive4 and both measurements (including\nmissing values) are in WeightLossIncentive.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Financial incentive-based approaches for weight loss,&quot; Journal of the American Medical Association by Volpp,\nJohn, Troxel, et. al., Vol. 200, no. 22, pp 2631-2637, (Dec. 2008)\n</p>\n</main>\n</div>\n",
