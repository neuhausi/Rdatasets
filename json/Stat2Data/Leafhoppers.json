One of the four was a control diet: just distilled water with no nutritive\nvalue. Each of the other three diets had a particular sugar added to the distilled water, one of\nglucose, sucrose, or fructose. Leafhoppers were sorted into groups of eight and each group was put\ninto one of eight lab dishes. Each of the four diets was added to two dishes, chosen using chance.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>&quot;Survival and behavioral responses of the potato leafhopper, Empoasca Fabae (Harris), on synthetic media,&quot; MS\nthesis by Douglas Dahlman (1963), Iowa State University.
