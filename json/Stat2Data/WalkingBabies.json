They were phoned weekly to check on their child's progress.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Exercise control: These parents were not shown the special exercises, but they were told to\nmake sure their babies spent at least 15 minutes a day exercising. <br />\n</p>\n<p>Weekly report: Parents in this group were not given instructions about exercise. Like the\nparents in the treatment group, however, they received a phone call each week to check on\nprogress.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Final report: These parents were not given weekly phone calls or instructions about exercises.\nThey reported at the end of the study.\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>Zelazo, Phillip R., Nancy Ann Zelazo, and Sarah Kolb (1972), &ldquo;Walking in the Newborn,&quot; Science, v. 176, pp.\n314-315.\n</p>\n</main>\n</div>\n",
