In order to reduce the\nnumber of observations, the was compressed by calculating the mean\nnumber of errors, putouts and assists for each team and for only 6\npositions (1B, 2B, 3B, C, OF, SS and UT).  In addition, each of these\nthree variables was scaled to a common range by dividing each variable\nby the maximum of the variable.",
