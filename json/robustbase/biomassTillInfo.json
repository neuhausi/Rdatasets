The effects of tillage on plant (maize) biomass were\nsubsequently determined by modeling biomass accumulation for each\ntillage treatment using a 3 parameter Weibull function.\nA datset where the total biomass is modeled conditional on a\nthree value factor, and hence vector parameters are used.",
