The response y is the occurence (y = 1) or\nnon-occurence (y = 0) of vaso constriction in the skin of the digits\nof a subject after he or she inhaled a certain volume of air at a certain\nrate.  The responses of three subjects are available.  The first\ncontributed 9 responses, the second contributed 8 responses, and the\nthird contributed 22 responses.",
