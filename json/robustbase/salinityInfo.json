This dataset was listed by Ruppert and\nCarroll (1980).  In Carrol and Ruppert (1985) the physical background of the\ndata is described.  They indicated that observations 5 and 16\ncorrespond to periods of very heavy discharge and showed that the\ndiscrepant observation 5 was masked by observations 3 and 16, i.e.,\nonly after deletion of these observations it was possible to identify\nthe influential observation 5.\nThis data set is a prime example of the masking effect.",
