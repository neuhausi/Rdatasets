The\ndata set consists of 75 observations in four dimensions (one response\nand three explanatory variables).  It provides a good example of the\nmasking effect.  The first 14 observations are outliers, created in\ntwo groups: 1&ndash;10 and 11&ndash;14.\nOnly observations 12, 13 and 14 appear as outliers when using\nclassical methods, but can be easily unmasked using robust\ndistances computed by, e.g., MCD - covMcd().",
