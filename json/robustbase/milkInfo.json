   "description" : "Description\nDaudin et al.(1988) give 8 readings on the composition of 86\ncontainers of milk.  They speak about 85 observations, but this\ncan be explained with the fact that observations 63 and 64 are\nidentical (as noted by Rocke (1996)).\nThe data set was used for analysing the stability of principal\ncomponent analysis by the bootstrap method.  In the same context, but\nusing high breakdown point robust PCA, these data were analysed by\nTodorov et al. (1994).  Atkinson (1994) used these data for ilustration\nof the forward search algorithm for identifying of multiple outliers.",
