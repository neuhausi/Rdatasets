The\nfirst variable is the logarithm of the effective temperature at the\nsurface of the star (Te) and the second one is the logarithm of its\nlight intencity (L/L_0).\nIn the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which is the scatterplot of these\ndata points, where the log temperature is plotted from left to right,\ntwo groups of points are seen:\nthe majority which tend to follow a steep band and four stars in the\nupper corner.  In the astronomy the 43 stars are said to lie on the\nmain sequence and the four remaining stars are called &ldquo;giants&rdquo; (the\npoints 11, 20, 30, 34).",
