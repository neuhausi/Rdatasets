   "description" : "Description\nThe Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) collected data north of\nChestnut Street in Florence, MA for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to\nNovember 15, 2005. Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam\nrecording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station.",
   "title" : "Volume of Users of a Massachusetts Rail Trail",
   "reference" : "There is a potential for error when two users trigger the infrared beam at exactly the same time\nsince the counter would only logs one of the crossings.  The collectors left the motion detector\nout during the winter, but because the counter drops data when the temperature falls below 14\ndegrees Fahrenheit, there are no data for the coldest winter months.",
