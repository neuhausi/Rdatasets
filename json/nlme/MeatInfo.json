Six storage periods ranging from 0 to 18 days were used.\nThirty roasts were scored by four judges on a scale from 0 to 10, with\nthe score increasing with tenderness. The response was the sum of all\nfour scores. Left and right roasts from the same animal were grouped\ninto pairs, which were further grouped into five blocks, according to\nthe muscle from which they were extracted. Different storage periods\nwere applied to each roast within a pair according to a balanced\nincomplete block design.",
