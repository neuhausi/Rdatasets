   "reference" : "Prater (1955) provides data on crude oil properties and\ngasoline yields.  Atkinson (1985)\nuses these data to illustrate the use of diagnostics in multiple\nregression analysis.  Three of the covariates&mdash;API,\nvapor, and ASTM&mdash;measure characteristics of the\ncrude oil used to produce the gasoline.  The other covariate &mdash;\nendpoint&mdash;is a characteristic of the refining process.\nDaniel and Wood (1980) notice that the covariates characterizing\nthe crude oil occur in only ten distinct groups and conclude that the\ndata represent responses measured on ten different crude oil samples.",
