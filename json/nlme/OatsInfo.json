The treatment structure used in the experiment was\na 3 \\times 4 full factorial, with three varieties of oats\nand four concentrations of nitrogen. The experimental units were\narranged into six blocks, each with three whole-plots subdivided into\nfour subplots. The varieties of oats were assigned randomly to the\nwhole-plots and the concentrations of nitrogen to the subplots.  All\nfour concentrations of nitrogen were used on each whole-plot."
