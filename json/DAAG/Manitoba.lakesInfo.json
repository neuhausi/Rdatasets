The geography of Manitoba (a relatively\nflat province) can be divided crudely into three main\nareas: a very flat prairie in the south which is at a \nrelatively high elevation, a middle region consisting\nof mainly of forest and Precambrian rock, and a northern\nregion which drains more rapidly into Hudson\nBay.  All water in Manitoba, which does not evaporate, eventually drains \ninto Hudson Bay.",
