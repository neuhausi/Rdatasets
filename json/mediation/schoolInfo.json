To deal\nwith the issue on individually identifiable information, we generated \nhypothetical student-level data using a multiple imputation method. The \nEducation Longitudinal Study of 2002 used a two-stage sample selection \nprocess. First, a national sample of schools was selected using stratified \nprobability proportional to size (PPS), and school contacting resulted in \n1,221 eligible public, Catholic, and other private schools from a population \nof approximately 27,000 schools containing 10th grade students. Of the \neligible schools, 752 participated in the study. In the second stage of \nsample selection, a sample of approximately 26 sophomores, from within each \nof the participating public and private schools was selected. Each school was\nasked to provide a list of 10th grade students, and quality assurance (QA) \nchecks were performed on each list that was received.",
