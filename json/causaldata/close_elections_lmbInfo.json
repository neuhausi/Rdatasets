   "description" : "Description\nThis data comes from a close-elections regression discontinuity study from Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004). The design is intended to test convergence and divergence in policy. Major effects of electing someone from a particular party on policy outcomes *in a close race* indicates that the victor does what they want. Small or null effects indicate that the electee moderates their position towards their nearly-split electorate.",
