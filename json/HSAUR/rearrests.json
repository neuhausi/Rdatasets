Matched\npairs were formed using criteria such as age and the number of\nprevious offences. For each pair, one subject was handled in\nthe juvenile court and the other was transferred to the adult\ncourt. Whether or not the juvenile was rearrested by the end \nof 1988 was then noted. Here the question of interest is whether\nthe true proportions rearrested were identical for the adult \nand juvenile court assignments?\n</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>A.
