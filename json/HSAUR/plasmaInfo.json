If the ESR increases\nwhen the level of certain proteins in the blood plasma rise in\nassociation with conditions such as rheumatic diseases, chronic\ninfections and malignant diseases, its determination might be\nuseful in screening blood samples taken form people suspected\nto being suffering from one of the conditions mentioned. The\nabsolute value of the ESR is not of great importance rather it\nis whether it is less than 20mm/hr since lower values indicate\na healthy individual.",
