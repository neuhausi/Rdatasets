Subsequently epidemiological studies\nof the disorder have consistently shown an earlier onset in men \nthan in women. One model that has been suggested to explain this\nobserved difference is know as the subtype model\nwhich postulates two type of schizophrenia, one characterised by early\nonset, typical symptoms and poor premorbid competence, and the\nother by late onset, atypical symptoms, and good premorbid competence.\nThe early onset type is assumed to be largely a disorder of men  \nand the late onset largely a disorder of women.",
