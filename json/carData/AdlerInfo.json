The experimenters were told prior to collecting \ndata that particular subjects were either high or low in their tendency to rate \nappearance of success, and were instructed to get good data, \nscientific data, or were given no such instruction. Each \nexperimenter collected ratings from 18 randomly assigned\nsubjects. This version of the Adler data is taken from Erickson and Nosanchuk (1977).\nThe data described in the original source, Adler (1973), have a more complex structure.",
