   "description" : "Description\nThese contrived repeated-measures data are taken from \nO'Brien and Kaiser (1985). The data are from an imaginary study in which\n16 female and male subjects, who are divided into three treatments, are measured\nat a pretest, postest, and a follow-up session; during each session, they are\nmeasured at five occasions at intervals of one hour. The design, therefore, has\ntwo between-subject and two within-subject factors.\nThe contrasts for the treatment factor are set to -2, 1, 1 and\n0, -1, 1. The contrasts for the gender factor are set to\ncontr.sum.",
