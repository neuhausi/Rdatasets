The area was divided into 4 \nblocks, in a randomized block design. (Suggested by Michael Friendly.)",

   "reference" : "These data provide good examples of MANOVA and canonical discriminant analysis in a somewhat\ncomplex multivariate setting.  They may be treated as a one-way design (ignoring Block),\nby using either Group or Gp as the factor, or a two-way randomized block\ndesign using Block, Contour and Depth (quantitative, so orthogonal\npolynomial contrasts are useful).",
