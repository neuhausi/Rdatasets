   "description" : "Description\nThis dataset was collected on a line transect survey in gilgai\nterritory in New South Wales, Australia.  Gilgais are natural gentle\ndepressions in otherwise flat land, and sometimes seem to be regularly\ndistributed. The data collection was stimulated by the question: are\nthese patterns reflected in soil properties?  At each of 365 sampling\nlocations on a linear grid of 4 meters spacing, samples were taken at\ndepths 0-10 cm, 30-40 cm and 80-90 cm below the surface. pH, electrical\nconductivity and chloride content were measured on a 1:5 soil:water\nextract from each sample.",
