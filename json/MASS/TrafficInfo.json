The\nexperiment was conducted on 92 days in each year, matched so that\nday j in 1962 was comparable to day j in 1961.  On some days\nthe speed limit was in effect and enforced, while on other days\nthere was no speed limit and cars tended to be driven faster.\nThe speed limit days tended to be in contiguous blocks.",
