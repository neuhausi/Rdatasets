There were two species of snail, A and B, and the\nexperiment was designed as a 4 by 3 by 4 by 2 completely randomized\ndesign.  At the end of the exposure time the snails were tested to see if\nthey had survived; the process itself is fatal for the animals.  The\nobject of the exercise was to model the probability of survival in terms of\nthe stimulus variables, and in particular to test for differences between\nspecies.\nThe data are unusual in that in most cases fatalities during the experiment\nwere fairly small.",
