   "description" : "Description\nFive rabbits were studied on two occasions, after treatment with\nsaline (control) and after treatment with the 5-HT_3 antagonist MDL\n72222.  After each treatment ascending doses of phenylbiguanide were\ninjected intravenously at 10 minute intervals and the responses of\nmean blood pressure measured.  The goal was to test whether the\ncardiogenic chemoreflex elicited by phenylbiguanide depends on the\nactivation of 5-HT_3 receptors.",
