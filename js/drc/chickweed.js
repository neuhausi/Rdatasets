The seeds were incubated for \n24 hours in a 0.3% solution of potassium nitrate in order to imbibe seeds prior to the test. A total of 200 seeds were placed on filter plate. \nAfter initialization of the tests, the number of germinated seeds was recorded and removed at 34 consecutive inspection times. \nDefinition of a germinated seed was the breakthrough of the seed testa by the radicle.",
