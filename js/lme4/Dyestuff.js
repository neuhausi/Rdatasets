In the experiment\nsix samples of the intermediate, representing different\nbatches of works manufacture, were obtained, and five\npreparations of the dyestuff were made in the laboratory\nfrom each sample. The equivalent yield of each\npreparation as grams of standard colour was determined by\ndye-trial.&rdquo;",
