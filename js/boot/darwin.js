Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant and one\nself-fertilized plant which germinated at the same time and grew in the\nsame pot. The plants were measured at a fixed time after planting and\nthe difference in heights between the cross- and self-fertilized plants are\nrecorded in eighths of an inch.",
