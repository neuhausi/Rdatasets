For 11 such ducks a\nbehavioural and plumage index were calculated.  These were measured on\nscales devised for this experiment which was to examine whether there\nwas any link between which species the ducks resembled physically and\nwhich they resembled in behaviour.  The scale for the physical\nappearance ranged from 0 (identical in appearance to a mallard) to 20\n(identical to a pintail).  The behavioural traits of the ducks were on\na scale from 0 to 15 with lower numbers indicating closer to\nmallard-like in behaviour.",
