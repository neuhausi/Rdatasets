   "description" : "Description\nPlayfair (1821) used a graph, showing parallel time-series of the price of wheat\nand the typical weekly wage for a \"good mechanic\" from 1565 to 1821 to argue\nthat working men had never been as well-off in terms of purchasing power as\nthey had become toward the end of this period.\nHis graph is a classic in the history of data visualization, but commits the\nsin of showing two non-commensurable Y variables on different axes.\nScatterplots of wages vs. price or plots of ratios (e.g., wages/price) \nare in some ways better, but both of these ideas were unknown in 1821.\nIn this version, information on the reigns of British monarchs is provided\nin a separate data.frame, Wheat.monarch.",
