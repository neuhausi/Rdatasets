   "description" : "Description\nThe Snow data consists of the relevant 1854 London streets, the location of 578 \ndeaths from cholera, and the position of 13 water pumps (wells)\nthat can be used to re-create John Snow's map showing deaths from\ncholera in the area surrounding Broad Street, London in the 1854 outbreak.\nAnother data frame provides boundaries of a tessellation of the map into \nThiessen (Voronoi) regions which include all cholera deaths nearer to\na given pump than to any other.\nThe apocryphal story of the significance of Snow's map is that, by closing  the\nBroad Street pump (by removing its  handle), Dr. Snow  stopped the epidemic,  and\ndemonstrated that  cholera is  a water  borne disease.  The method of contagion of cholera\nwas  not previously\nunderstood. Snow's map is the most famous and classical example in the field  of\nmedical cartography, even if  it didn't happen exactly  this way.\n(the apocryphal part is that the epidemic ended when the pump handle was removed.)\nAt any  rate,\nthe map, together with  various statistical annotations,  is  compelling because\nit points to the Broad Street pump as the source of the outbreak.",
