Quetelet (1846) used this\ndata as a demonstration of the normal distribution of physical characteristics and the\nconcept of l'homme moyen.\nStigler (1986) compared this table to the original 1817 source, and discovered some transcription\nerrors, which he corrected (p. 208).  These data are given separately in\nChestStigler.\nGallagher (2020) used these data sets to re-consider the question of normality in these distributions."
