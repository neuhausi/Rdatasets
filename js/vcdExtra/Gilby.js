   "description" : "Description\nSchoolboys were classified according to their clothing and to their teachers rating of \"dullness\"\n(lack of intelligence), in a 5 x 7 table originally from \nGilby (1911).\nAnscombe (1981) presents a slightly collapsed 4 x 6 table, used here, where \nthe last two categories of clothing were pooled as were the first two categories of dullness due to small counts.\nBoth Dullness and Clothing are ordered categories, so models and methods\nthat examine their association in terms of ordinal categories are profitable."
