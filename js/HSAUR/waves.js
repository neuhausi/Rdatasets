   "reference" : "In a design study for a device to generate electricity from\nwave power at sea, experiments were carried out on scale models\nin a wave tank to establish how the choice of mooring method\nfor the system affected the bending stress produced in part of\nthe device. The wave tank could simulate a wide range of sea\nstates and the model system was subjected to the same sample \nof sea states with each of two mooring methods, one of which    \nwas considerably cheaper than the other.\nThe question of interest is whether bending stress differs\nfor the two mooring methods.",
