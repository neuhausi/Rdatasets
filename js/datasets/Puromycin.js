The number of counts per minute of radioactive\nproduct from the reaction was measured as a function of substrate\nconcentration in parts per million (ppm) and from these counts the\ninitial rate (or velocity) of the reaction was calculated\n(counts/min/min).  The experiment was conducted once with the enzyme\ntreated with Puromycin, and once with the enzyme untreated.",
