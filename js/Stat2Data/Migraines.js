Researchers recruited 200 subjects who\nsuffered from migraines and randomly assigned them to receive either the TMS (transcranial magnetic\nstimulation) treatment or a sham (placebo) treatment from a device that did not deliver any\nstimulation. Subjects were instructed to apply the device at the onset of migraine symptoms and\nthen assess how they felt two hours later. This dataset is a two-way table of the results.",
