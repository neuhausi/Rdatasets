Their experiment used four human subjects, and\ntook place over several days. Each day each subject swallowed a tablet containing one of caffeine,\ntheobromine, or the placebo. Two hours later they were timed while tapping a finger in a specified\nmanner (that they had practiced earlier, to control for learning effects).
