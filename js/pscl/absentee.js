The result in the Senate election\nin the 2nd district (based in Philadelphia) was challenged in court,\nand ultimately overturned. The Democratic candidate won 19,127 of\nthe votes cast by voting machine, while the Republican won 19,691\nvotes cast by voting machine, giving the Republican a lead of 564\nvotes. However, the Democrat won 1,396 absentee ballots, while the\nRepublican won just 371 absentee ballots, more than offsetting the\nRepublican lead based on the votes recorded by machines on election\nday. The Republican candidate sued, claiming that many of the absentee\nballots were fraudulent. The judge in the case solicited expert\nanalysis from Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at Princeton\nUniversity. Ashenfelter examined the relationship between absentee\nvote margins and machine vote margins in 21 previous Pennsylvania\nSenate elections in seven districts in the Philadelphia area over the\npreceding decade.",
